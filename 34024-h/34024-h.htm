<h1>RUTH FIELDING AT LIGHTHOUSE POINT</h1>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_1'></a>1</span><a id='link_1'></a>CHAPTER I<br /><span class='h2fs'>AN INITIATION</span></h2>

<p><span class='sc'>A brown</span> dusk filled the long room, for although
the windows were shrouded thickly and
no lamp burned, some small ray of light percolated
from without and made dimly visible the
outlines of the company there gathered.</p>

<p>The low, quavering notes of an organ sighed
through the place. There was the rustle and
movement of a crowd. To the neophyte, who
had been brought into the hall with eyes bandaged,
it all seemed very mysterious and awe-inspiring.</p>

<p>Now she was set in a raised place and felt that
before her was the company of masked and
shrouded figures, in scarlet dominoes like those
worn by the two guards who had brought her
from the anteroom. The bandage was whisked
from her eyes; but she could see nothing of her
surroundings, nor of the company before which
she stood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Candidate!&#8221; spoke a hollow, mysterious
voice somewhere in the gloom, yet sounding so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2'></a>2</span>
close to her ear that she started. &#8220;Candidate!
you stand before the membership body of the
S.&#160;B.&#8217;s. You are as yet unknown to them and they
unknown to you. If you enter the secret association
of the S.&#160;B.&#8217;s you must throw off and despise
forever all ties of a like character. Do you
agree?&#8221;</p>

<p>The candidate obeyed, in so far as she prodded
her sharply in the ribs and a shrill voice whispered:
&#8220;Say you do&#8211;gump!&#8221;</p>

<p>The candidate obeyed, in so far as she proclaimed
that she did, at least.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is an oath,&#8221; went on the sepulchral voice.
&#8220;Remember!&#8221;</p>

<p>In chorus the assembly immediately repeated,
&#8220;Remember!&#8221; in solemn tones.</p>

<p>&#8220;Candidate!&#8221; repeated the leading voice,
&#8220;you have been taught the leading object of our
existence as a society. What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Without hesitation now, the candidate replied:
&#8220;Helpfulness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is right. And now, what do our initials
stand for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sweetbriar,&#8221; replied the shaking voice of the
candidate.</p>

<p>&#8220;True. That is what our initials stand for to
the world at large&#8211;to those who are not initiated
into the mysteries of the S.&#160;B.&#8217;s. But those letters
may stand for many things and it is my privilege
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3'></a>3</span>
to explain to you now that they likewise are
to remind us all of two virtues that each Sweetbriar
is expected to practice&#8211;to be sincere and to
befriend. Remember! Sincerity&#8211;Befriend. Remember!&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the chorus of mysterious voices chanted:
&#8220;Remember!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And now let the light shine upon the face of
the candidate, that the Shrouded Sisterhood may
know her where&#8217;er they meet her. Once! Twice!
Thrice! Light!&#8221;</p>

<p>At the cry the ray of a spot-light flashed out of
the gloom at the far end of the long room and
played glaringly upon the face and figure of the
candidate. She herself was more blinded by the
glare than she had been by the bandage. There
was a rustle and movement in the room, and the
leading voice went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;Sisters! the novice is now revealed to us all.
She has now entered into the outer circle of the
Sweetbriars. Let her know us, where&#8217;er she meets
us, by our rallying cry. Once! Twice! Thrice!
<i>Now!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Instantly, and in unison, the members chanted
the following &#8220;yell&#8221;:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>&#8220;S.&#160;B.&#8211;Ah-h-h!</p>
<p>S.&#160;B.&#8211;Ah-h-h!</p>
<p>Sound our battle-cry</p>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4'></a>4</span>Near and far!</p>
<p>S.&#160;B.&#8211;All!</p>
<p>Briarwood Hall!</p>
<p>Sweetbriars, do or die&#8211;</p>
<p>This be our battle-cry&#8211;</p>
<p>Briarwood Hall!</p>
<p><i>That&#8217;s All!</i>&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>With the final word the spot-light winked out
and the other lights of the hall flashed on. The
assembly of hooded and shrouded figures were revealed.
And Helen Cameron, half smiling and
half crying, found herself standing upon the platform
before her schoolmates who had already
joined the secret fraternity known as &#8220;The
Sweetbriars.&#8221;</p>

<p>Beside her, and presiding over the meeting,
she found her oldest and dearest friend at Briarwood
Hall&#8211;Ruth Fielding. A small megaphone
stood upon the table at Ruth&#8217;s hand, and its use
had precluded Helen&#8217;s recognition of her chum&#8217;s
voice as the latter led in the ritual of the fraternity.
Like their leader, the other Sweetbriars
had thrown back their scarlet hoods, and Helen
recognized almost all of the particular friends
with whom she had become associated since she
had come&#8211;with Ruth Fielding&#8211;the autumn before
to Briarwood Hall.</p>

<p>The turning on of the lights was the signal for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5'></a>5</span>
general conversation and great merriment. It
was the evening of the last day but one of the
school year, and discipline at Briarwood Hall was
relaxed to a degree. However, the fraternity of
the Sweetbriars had grown in favor with Mrs.
Grace Tellingham, the preceptress of the school,
and with the teachers, since its inception. Now
the fifty or more girls belonging to the society
(fully a quarter of the school membership)
paired off to march down to the dining hall, where
a special collation was spread.</p>

<p>Helen Cameron went down arm-in-arm with
the president of the S.&#160;B.&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Ruthie!&#8221; the new member exclaimed, &#8220;I
think it&#8217;s ever so nice&#8211;much better than the initiation
of the old Upedes. I can talk about them
now,&#8221; and she laughed, &#8220;because they are&#8211;as
Tommy says&#8211;&#8216;busted all to flinders.&#8217; Haven&#8217;t
held a meeting for more than a month, and the
last time&#8211;whisper! this is a secret, and I guess
the last remaining secret of the Upedes&#8211;there
were only The Fox and I there!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re one of us at last, Helen,&#8221;
said Ruth Fielding, squeezing her chum as they
went down the stairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I ought to have been an original member
along with you, Ruth,&#8221; said Helen, thoughtfully.
&#8220;The Up and Doing Club hadn&#8217;t half the
attractiveness that your society has<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6'></a>6</span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t call it <i>my</i> society. We don&#8217;t want any
one-girl club. That was the trouble with the Up
and Doings&#8211;just as &#8216;too much faculty&#8217; is the objection
to the Forward Club.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I detest the Fussy Curls just as much as
ever,&#8221; declared Helen, quickly, &#8220;although Madge
Steele <i>is</i> president.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we &#8216;Infants,&#8217; as they called us last fall
when we entered Briarwood, are in control of the
S.&#160;B.&#8217;s, and we can help each other,&#8221; said Ruth,
with satisfaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you talk about the Upedes being a one-girl
club. I know The Fox was all-in-all in that.
But you&#8217;re pretty near the whole thing in the
S.&#160;B.&#8217;s, Ruthie,&#8221; and Helen laughed, slily. &#8220;Why,
they say you wrote all the ritual and planned
everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; said Ruth, calmly; &#8220;we can&#8217;t
have a dictator in the S.&#160;B.&#8217;s without changing the
constitution. The same girl can&#8217;t be president for
more than one year.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you deserve to boss it all,&#8221; said her
chum, warmly. &#8220;And I for one wouldn&#8217;t mind
if you did.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen was a very impulsive, enthusiastic girl.
When she and Ruth Fielding had come to Briarwood
Hall she had immediately taken up with a
lively and thoughtless set of girls who had banded
themselves into the Up and Doing Club, and
whose leader was Mary Cox, called &#8220;The Fox,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7'></a>7</span>
because of her shrewdness. Ruth had not cared
for this particular society and, in time, she and
most of the other new pupils formed the Sweetbriar
Club. Helen Cameron, loyal to her first
friends at the school, had not fallen away from
Mary Cox and joined the Sweetbriars until this
very evening, which was, as we have seen, the
evening before the final day of the school year.</p>

<p>Ruth Fielding took the head of the table when
the girls sat down to supper and the other officers
of the club sat beside her. Helen was therefore
separated from her, and when the party broke up
late in the evening (the curfew bell at nine o&#8217;clock
was abolished for this one night) the chums started
for their room in the West Dormitory at different
times. Ruth went with Mercy Curtis, who
was lame; outside the dining hall Helen chanced
to meet Mary Cox, who had been calling on
some party in the East Dormitory building.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Cameron!&#8221; exclaimed The Fox. &#8220;So
you&#8217;ve finally been roped in by the &#8216;Soft Babies&#8217;
have you? I thought that chum of yours&#8211;Fielding&#8211;would
manage to get you hobbled and tied
before vacation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t say I wasn&#8217;t loyal to the Upedes as
long as there was any society to be loyal to,&#8221; said
Helen, quickly, and with a flush.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well; you&#8217;ll be going down to Heavy&#8217;s
seashore cottage with them now, I suppose?&#8221;
said The Fox, still watching Helen curiously.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span>&#8220;Why, of course! I intended to before,&#8221; returned
the younger girl. &#8220;We all agreed about
that last winter when we were at Snow Camp.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you did, eh?&#8221; laughed the other. &#8220;Well,
if you hadn&#8217;t joined the Soft Babies you wouldn&#8217;t
have been &#8216;axed,&#8217; when it came time to go. This
is going to be an S.&#160;B. frolic. Your nice little Ruth
Fielding says she won&#8217;t go if Heavy invites any
but her precious Sweetbriars to be of the party.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it, Mary Cox!&#8221; cried Helen.
&#8220;I mean, that <i>you</i> must be misinformed. Somebody
has maligned Ruth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! Maybe, but it doesn&#8217;t look like it.
Who is going to Lighthouse Point?&#8221; demanded
The Fox, carelessly. &#8220;Madge Steele, for although
she is president of the Fussy Curls, she is
likewise honorary member of the S.&#160;B.&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is so,&#8221; admitted Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heavy, herself,&#8221; pursued Mary Cox, &#8220;Belle
and Lluella, who have all backslid from the
Upedes, and yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;ve been invited,&#8221; said Helen, quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much. I tell you, if you and Belle and
Lluella had not joined her S.&#160;B.&#8217;s you wouldn&#8217;t
have been numbered among Heavy&#8217;s house party.
Don&#8217;t fool yourself on that score,&#8221; and with another
unpleasant laugh, the older girl walked on
and left Helen in a much perturbed state of mind.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Ruth Fielding</span>, after the death of her parents,
when she was quite a young girl, had come
from Darrowtown to live with her mother&#8217;s uncle
at the Red Mill, on the Lumano River near Cheslow,
as was related in the first volume of this
series, entitled, &#8220;Ruth Fielding of the Red Mill;
Or, Jasper Parloe&#8217;s Secret.&#8221; Ruth had found
Uncle Jabez very hard to get along with at first,
for he was a miser, and his kinder nature seemed
to have been crusted over by years of hoarding
and selfishness.</p>

<p>But through a happy turn of circumstances
Ruth was enabled to get at the heart of her crotchety
uncle, and when Ruth&#8217;s very dear friend, Helen
Cameron, planned to go to boarding school, Uncle
Jabez was won over to sending Ruth with her.
The fun and work of that first half at school are
related in the second volume of the series, entitled
&#8220;Ruth Fielding at Briarwood Hall; Or, Solving
the Campus Mystery.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the third volume of the series, &#8220;Ruth Fielding
at Snow Camp; Or, Lost in the Backwoods,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span>
Ruth and some of her school friends spend a part
of the mid-winter vacation at Mr. Cameron&#8217;s
hunting lodge in the Big Woods, where they enjoy
many winter sports and have adventures galore.</p>

<p>Ruth and Helen occupied a &#8220;duo&#8221; room on
the second floor of the West Dormitory; but
when Mercy Curtis, the lame girl, had come to
Briarwood in the middle of the first term, the
chums had taken her in with them, the occupants
of that particular study being known thereafter
among the girls of Briarwood as the Triumvirate.</p>

<p>Helen, when deserted by The Fox, who, from
that first day at Briarwood Hall, had shown herself
to be jealous of Ruth Fielding, for some reason,
went slowly up to her room and found Ruth
and Mercy there before her. There was likewise
a stout, doll-faced, jolly girl with them, known to
the other girls as &#8220;Heavy,&#8221; but rightly owning
the name of Jennie Stone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here she is now!&#8221; cried this latter, on
Helen&#8217;s appearance. &#8220;&#8216;The candidate will now
advance and say her a-b-abs!&#8217; You looked scared
to death when they shot you with the lime-light.
I was chewing a caramel when they initiated me,
and I swallowed it whole, and pretty near choked,
when the spot-light was turned on.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mercy, who was a very sharp girl indeed, was
looking at Helen slily. She saw that something
had occasioned their friend annoyance.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>&#8220;What&#8217;s happened to you since we came from
the supper, Helen?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indigestion!&#8221; gasped Heavy. &#8220;I&#8217;ve some
pepsin tablets in my room. Want one, Nell?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I am all right,&#8221; declared Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we were just waiting for you to come
in,&#8221; the stout girl said. &#8220;Maybe we&#8217;ll all be so
busy to-morrow that we won&#8217;t have time to talk
about it. So we must plan for the Lighthouse
Point campaign now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said Helen, slowly. &#8220;So you can
make up your party now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course! Why, we really made it up last
winter; didn&#8217;t we?&#8221; laughed Heavy.</p>

<p>&#8220;But we didn&#8217;t know whether we could go or
not then,&#8221; Ruth Fielding said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t know whether <i>I</i> could go, I suppose
you mean?&#8221; suggested Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&#8211;not particularly,&#8221; responded Ruth, in
some wonder at her chum&#8217;s tone. &#8220;I supposed
you and Tom would go. Your father so seldom
refuses you anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know how Uncle Jabez would look
at it,&#8221; pursued Ruth. &#8220;But I wrote him a while
ago and told him you and Mercy were going to
accept Jennie&#8217;s invite, and he said I could go to
Lighthouse Point, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said Helen again. &#8220;You didn&#8217;t wait
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span>
until I joined the S.&#160;B.&#8217;s, then, to decide whether
you would accept Heavy&#8217;s invitation, or not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How ridiculous!&#8221; cried Heavy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s to be a Sweetbriar frolic; isn&#8217;t it,
Heavy?&#8221; asked Helen, calmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Madge and Bob Steele are going.
And your brother Tom,&#8221; chuckled the stout girl.
&#8220;And perhaps that Isadore Phelps. You
wouldn&#8217;t call Busy Izzy a Sweetbriar; would
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean the boys,&#8221; returned Helen, with
some coolness.</p>

<p>Suddenly Mercy Curtis, her head on one side
and her thin little face twisted into a most knowing
grimace, interrupted. &#8220;I know what this
means!&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do <i>you</i> mean, Goody Two-Sticks?&#8221;
demanded Ruth, kindly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our Helen has a grouch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; muttered Helen, flushing again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought something didn&#8217;t fit her when she
came in,&#8221; said Heavy, calmly. &#8220;But I thought
it was indigestion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What <i>is</i> the matter, Helen?&#8221; asked Ruth
Fielding in wonder.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Fee, fi, fo fum! I see the negro run!&#8217;&#8211;into
the woodpile!&#8221; ejaculated the lame girl, in
her biting way. &#8220;I know what is the matter with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>
Queen Helen of Troy. She&#8217;s been with The
Fox.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ruth and Heavy stared at Mercy in surprise;
but Helen turned her head aside.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the answer!&#8221; chuckled the shrewd little
creature. &#8220;I saw them walk off together
after supper. And The Fox has been trying to
make trouble&#8211;same as usual.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mary Cox! Why, that&#8217;s impossible,&#8221; said
Heavy, good-naturedly. &#8220;She wouldn&#8217;t say anything
to make Helen feel bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mercy darted an accusing fore-finger at Helen,
and still kept her eyes screwed up. &#8220;I dare you
to tell! I dare you to tell!&#8221; she cried in a singsong
voice.</p>

<p>Helen had to laugh at last.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Mary Cox said you had decided to have
none but Sweetbriars at the cottage on the beach,
Heavy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lot she knows about it,&#8221; grunted the stout
girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Heavy asked her to go; didn&#8217;t she?&#8221;
cried Ruth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that was last Winter. I didn&#8217;t press
her,&#8221; admitted the stout girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;But she&#8217;s your roommate, like Belle and
Lluella,&#8221; said Ruth, in some heat. &#8220;Of course
you&#8217;ve got to ask her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you do it. She&#8217;s a spoil-sport,&#8221; declared
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>
Mercy Curtis, in her sharp way. &#8220;The
Fox will keep us all in hot water.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do be still, Mercy!&#8221; cried Ruth. &#8220;This is
Heavy&#8217;s own affair. And Mary Cox has been
her roommate ever since she&#8217;s been at Briarwood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that Belle and Lluella can go
with us,&#8221; said the stout girl, slowly. &#8220;The fright
they got up in the woods last Winter scared their
mothers. I guess they think I&#8217;m too reckless.
Sort of wild, you know,&#8221; and the stout girl&#8217;s smile
broadened.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you intended inviting Mary Cox?&#8221; demanded
Ruth, steadily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I said something about it to her. But
she wouldn&#8217;t give me a decided answer then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ask her again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you do it!&#8221; exclaimed Mercy, sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean it, Jennie,&#8221; Ruth said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t please both of you,&#8221; said the good-natured
stout girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please me. Mercy doesn&#8217;t mean what she
says. If Mary Cox thinks that I am opposed to
your having her at Lighthouse Point, I shall be
offended if you do not immediately insist upon her
being one of the party.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;ll suit The Fox right down to the
ground,&#8221; exclaimed Mercy. &#8220;That is what she
was fishing for when she got at Helen to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>&#8220;Did <i>I</i> say she said anything about Lighthouse
Point?&#8221; quickly responded Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t have to,&#8221; rejoined Mercy,
sharply. &#8220;We knew.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At least,&#8221; Ruth said to Heavy, quietly, yet with
decision, &#8220;you will ask your old friend to go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&#8211;if you don&#8217;t mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There seems to have been some truth in
Mary&#8217;s supposition, then,&#8221; Ruth said, sadly.
&#8220;She thinks I intended to keep her out of a good
time. I never thought of such a thing. If Mary
Cox does not accept your invitation, Heavy, I
shall be greatly disappointed. Indeed, I shall be
tempted to decline to go to the shore with you.
Now, remember that, Jennie Stone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, shucks! you&#8217;re making too much fuss
about it,&#8221; said the stout girl, rising lazily, and
speaking in her usual drawling manner. &#8220;Of
course I&#8217;ll have her&#8211;if she&#8217;ll go. Father&#8217;s
bungalow is big enough, goodness knows. And
we&#8217;ll have lots of fun there.&#8221;</p>

<p>She went her leisurely way to the door. Had
she been brisker of movement, when she turned
the knob she would have found Mary Cox with
her ear at the keyhole, drinking in all that had
been said in the room of the triumvirate. But
The Fox was as swift of foot as she was shrewd
and sly of mind. She was out of sight and hearing
when Jennie Stone came out into the corridor.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span><a id='link_3'></a>CHAPTER III<br /><span class='h2fs'>ON LAKE OSAGO</span></h2>

<p><span class='sc'>The</span> final day of the school year was always a
gala occasion at Briarwood Hall. Although
Ruth Fielding and her chum, Helen Cameron,
had finished only their first year, they both had
important places in the exercises of graduation.
Ruth sang in the special chorus, while Helen
played the violin in the school orchestra. Twenty-four
girls were in the graduating class. Briarwood
Hall prepared for Wellesley, or any of the
other female colleges, and when Mrs. Grace Tellingham,
the preceptress, graduated a girl with
a certificate it meant that the young lady was well
grounded in all the branches that Briarwood
taught.</p>

<p>The campus was crowded with friends of the
graduating class, and of the Seniors in particular.
It was a very gay scene, for the June day was perfect
and the company were brightly dressed. The
girls, however, including the graduating class,
were dressed in white only. Mrs. Tellingham
had established that custom some years before,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>
and the different classes were distinguished only
by the color of their ribbons.</p>

<p>Helen Cameron&#8217;s twin brother, Tom, and
Madge Steele&#8217;s brother, Bob, attended the Seven
Oaks Military Academy, not many miles from
Briarwood. Their graduation exercises and
&#8220;Breaking Up,&#8221; as the boys called it, were one
day later than the same exercises at Briarwood.
So the girls did not start for home until the morning
of the latter day.</p>

<p>Old Dolliver, the stage driver, brought his
lumbering stage to the end of the Cedar Walk at
nine o&#8217;clock, to which point Tony Foyle, the man-of-all-work,
had wheeled the girls&#8217; baggage.
Ruth, and Helen, and Mercy Curtis had bidden
their room good-bye and then made the round of
the teachers before this hour. They gathered
here to await the stage with Jennie Stone, Madge
and Mary Cox. The latter had agreed to be one
of the party at Lighthouse Point and was going
home with Heavy to remain during the ensuing
week, before the seashore party should be made
up.</p>

<p>The seven girls comfortably filled the stage,
with their hand luggage, while the trunks and
suitcases in the boot and roped upon the roof
made the Ark seem top-heavy. There was a
crowd of belated pupils, and those who lived in
the neighborhood, to see them off, and the coach
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>
finally rolled away to the famous tune of &#8220;Uncle
Noah, He Built an Ark,&#8221; wherein Madge Steele
put her head out of the window and &#8220;lined out&#8221;
a new verse to the assembled &#8220;well-wishers&#8221;:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>&#8220;And they didn&#8217;t know where they were at,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;One wide river to cross!</p>
<p>Till the Sweetbriars showed &#8217;em that!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;One wide river to cross!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One wide river!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One wide river of Jordan&#8211;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One wide river!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One wide river to cross!&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>For although Madge Steele was now president
of the Forward Club, a much older school fraternity
than the Sweetbriars, she was, like Mrs.
Tellingham, and Miss Picolet, the French teacher,
and others of the faculty, an honorary member of
the society started by Ruth Fielding. The Sweetbriars,
less than one school year old, was fast becoming
the most popular organization at Briarwood
Hall.</p>

<p>Mary Cox did not join in the singing, nor did
she have a word to say to Ruth during the ride
to the Seven Oaks station. Tom and Bob, with
lively, inquisitive, harum-scarum Isadore Phelps&#8211;&#8220;Busy Izzy,&#8221;
as his mates called him&#8211;were
at the station to meet the party from Briarwood
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>
Hall. Tom was a dark-skinned, handsome lad,
while Bob was big, and flaxen-haired, and bashful.
Madge, his sister, called him &#8220;Sonny&#8221; and
made believe he was at the pinafore stage of
growth instead of being almost six feet tall and
big in proportion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s the dear little fellow!&#8221; she cried,
jumping lightly out to be hugged by the big fellow.
&#8220;Let Sister see how he&#8217;s grown since New
Year&#8217;s. Why, we&#8217;d hardly have known our
Bobbins; would we, Ruthie? Let me fix your
tie&#8211;it&#8217;s under your ear, of course. Now, that&#8217;s
a neat little boy. You can shake hands with
Ruthie, and Helen, and Mary, and Jennie, and
Mercy Curtis&#8211;and help Uncle Noah get off the
trunks.&#8221;</p>

<p>The three boys, being all of the freshman class
at Seven Oaks, had less interest in the final exercises
of the term at the Academy than the girls
had had at Briarwood; therefore the whole party
took a train that brought them to the landing at
Portageton, on Osago Lake, before noon. From
that point the steamer <i>Lanawaxa</i> would transport
them the length of the lake to another railroad
over which the young folks must travel to reach
Cheslow.</p>

<p>At this time of year the great lake was a beautiful
sight. Several lines of steamers plied upon
it; the summer resorts on the many islands which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>
dotted it, and upon the shores of the mainland,
were gay with flags and banners; the sail up the
lake promised to be a most delightful one.</p>

<p>And it would have been so&#8211;delightful for the
whole party&#8211;had it not been for a single member.
The Fox could not get over her unfriendly
feeling, although Ruth Fielding gave her no cause
at all. Ruth tried to talk to Mary, at first; but
finding the older girl determined to be unpleasant,
she let her alone.</p>

<p>On the boat the three boys gathered camp-chairs
for the party up forward, and their pocket
money went for candy and other goodies with
which to treat their sisters and the latter&#8217;s friends.
There were not many people aboard the <i>Lanawaxa</i>
on this trip and the young folks going home
from school had the forward upper deck to themselves.
There was a stiff breeze blowing that
drove the other passengers into the inclosed
cabins.</p>

<p>But the girls and their escorts were in high
spirits. As Madge Steele declared, &#8220;they had
slipped the scholastic collar for ten long weeks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if we can&#8217;t find a plenty of fun in that
time it&#8217;s our own fault,&#8221; observed Heavy&#8211;having
some trouble with her articulation because of the
candy in her mouth. &#8220;Thanks be to goodness!
no rising bell&#8211;no curfew&#8211;no getting anywhere
at any particular time. Oh, I&#8217;m just going to lie
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>
in the sand all day, when we get to the Point<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And have your meals brought to you,
Heavy?&#8221; queried Ruth, slily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never you mind about the meals, Miss.
Mammy Laura&#8217;s going down with us to cook,
and if there&#8217;s one thing Mammy Laura loves to
do, it&#8217;s to cook messes for me&#8211;and bring them to
me. She&#8217;s always been afraid that my health was
delicate and that I needed more nourishing food
than the rest of the family. Such custards!
Um! um!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do go down and see if there is anything left
on the lunch counter, boys,&#8221; begged Helen,
anxiously. &#8220;Otherwise we won&#8217;t get Heavy
home alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>am</i> a little bit hungry, having had no dinner,&#8221;
admitted the stout girl, reflectively.</p>

<p>The boys went off, laughing. &#8220;She&#8217;s so
feeble!&#8221; cried Mary Cox, pinching the stout girl.
&#8220;We never should travel with her alone. There
ought to be a trained nurse and a physician along.
I&#8217;m worried to death about her<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ouch! stop your pinching!&#8221; commanded
Jennie, and rose up rather suddenly, for her, to
give chase to her tormentor.</p>

<p>The Fox was as quick as a cat, and Heavy was
lubberly in her movements. The lighter girl,
laughing shrilly, ran forward and vaulted over
the low rail that separated the awning-covered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>
upper deck from the unrailed roof of the lower
deck forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better come back from there!&#8221; Ruth
cried, instantly. &#8220;It&#8217;s wet and slippery.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Fox turned on her instantly, her face
flushed and her eyes snapping.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mind your business, Miss!&#8221; she cried, stamping
her foot. &#8220;I can look out<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Her foot slipped. Heavy thoughtlessly
laughed. None of them really thought of danger
save Ruth. But Mary Cox lost her foothold,
slid toward the edge of the sloping deck, and the
next instant, as the <i>Lanawaxa</i> plunged a little
sideways (for the sharp breeze had raised quite
a little sea) The Fox shot over the brink of the
deck and, with a scream, disappeared feet-first
into the lake.</p>

<p>It all happened so quickly that nobody but the
group of girls on the forward deck had seen the
accident. And Madge, Heavy and Helen were
all helpless&#8211;so frightened that they could only
cry out.</p>

<p>&#8220;She can&#8217;t swim!&#8221; gasped Helen. &#8220;She&#8217;ll be
drowned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The paddle-wheel will hit her!&#8221; added
Madge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! where are those useless boys?&#8221; demanded
the stout girl. &#8220;They&#8217;re never around
when they could be of use.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>But Ruth said never a word. The emergency
appealed to her quite as seriously as it
did to her friends. But she knew that if Mary
Cox was to be saved they must act at once.</p>

<p>She flung off her cap and light outside coat.
She wore only canvas shoes, and easily kicked
them off and ran, in her stocking-feet, toward the
paddle-box. Onto this she climbed by the short
ladder and sprang out upon its top just as The
Fox came up after her plunge.</p>

<p>By great good fortune the imperiled girl had
been carried beyond the paddles. But the <i>Lanawaxa</i>
was steaming swiftly past the girl in the
water. Ruth knew very well that Mary Cox
could not swim. She was one of the few girls at
Briarwood who had been unable to learn that accomplishment,
under the school instructor, in the
gymnasium pool. Whereas Ruth herself had
taken to the art &#8220;like a duck to water.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary&#8217;s face appeared but for a moment above
the surface. Ruth saw it, pale and despairing;
then a wave washed over it and the girl disappeared
for a second time.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span><a id='link_4'></a>CHAPTER IV<br /><span class='h2fs'>TROUBLE AT THE RED MILL</span></h2>

<p><span class='sc'>The</span> screams of the other girls had brought
several of the male passengers as well as some of
the boat&#8217;s crew to the forward deck. Mercy Curtis,
who had lain down in a stateroom to rest,
drew back the blind and saw Ruth poised on the
wheel-box.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you do that, Ruth Fielding!&#8221; cried the
lame girl, who knew instinctively what her friend&#8217;s
intention was.</p>

<p>But Ruth paid no more attention to her than
she had to the other girls. She was wearing a
heavy serge skirt, and she knew it would hamper
her in the water. With nimble fingers she unfastened
this and dropped it upon the deck.
Then, without an instant&#8217;s hesitation, she sprang
far out from the steamer, her body shooting
straight down, feet-first, to the water.</p>

<p>Ruth was aware as she shot downward that
Tom Cameron was at the rail over her head.
The <i>Lanawaxa</i> swept by and he, having run
astern, leaned over and shouted to her. She had
a glimpse of something swinging out from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>
rail, too, and dropping after her into the lake,
and as the water closed over her head she realized
that he had thrown one of the lifebuoys.</p>

<p>But deep as the water was, Ruth had no fear
for herself. She loved to swim and the instructor
at Briarwood had praised her skill. The only
anxiety she had as she sank beneath the surface
was for Mary Cox, who had already gone down
twice.</p>

<p>She had leaped into the lake near where The
Fox had disappeared. Once beneath the surface,
Ruth opened her eyes and saw the shadow
of somebody in the water ahead. Three strokes
brought her within reach of it. She seized Mary
Cox by the hair, and although her school fellow
was still sinking, Ruth, with sturdy strokes, drew
her up to the surface.</p>

<p>What a blessing it was to obtain a draught of
pure air! But The Fox was unconscious, and
Ruth had to bear her weight up, while treading
water, until she could dash the drops from her
eyes. There was the lifebuoy not ten yards away.
She struck out for it with one hand, while towing
Mary with the other. Long before the steamer
had been stopped and a boat lowered and manned,
Ruth and her burden reached the great ring, and
the girls were comparatively safe.</p>

<p>Tom Cameron came in the boat, having forced
himself in with the crew, and it was he who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>
hauled Mary Cox over the gunwale, and then
aided Ruth into the boat.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the second time you&#8217;ve saved that girl
from drowning, Ruth,&#8221; he gasped. &#8220;The first
time was last Fall when you and I hauled her out
of the hole in the ice on Triton Lake. And now
she would have gone down and stayed down if
you hadn&#8217;t dived for her. Now! don&#8217;t you ever
do it again!&#8221; concluded the excited lad.</p>

<p>Had Ruth not been so breathless she must have
laughed at him; but there really was a serious
side to the adventure. Mary Cox did not recover
her senses until after they were aboard the
steamer. Ruth was taken in hand by a stewardess,
undressed and put between blankets, and her
clothing dried and made presentable before the
steamer docked at the head of the lake.</p>

<p>As Tom Cameron had said, Mary Cox had
fallen through the ice early in the previous Winter,
and Ruth had aided in rescuing her; The Fox
had never even thanked the girl from the Red
Mill for such aid. And now Ruth shrank from
meeting her and being thanked on this occasion.
Ruth had to admit to herself that she looked forward
with less pleasure to the visit to the seashore
with Heavy because Mary Cox was to be of the
party. She could not like The Fox, and she
really had ample reason.</p>

<p>The other girls ran into the room where Ruth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>
was and reported when Mary became conscious,
and how the doctor said that she would never
have come up to the surface again, she had taken
so much water into her lungs, had not Ruth
grasped her. They had some difficulty in bringing
The Fox to her senses.</p>

<p>&#8220;And aren&#8217;t you the brave one, Ruthie Fielding!&#8221;
cried Heavy. &#8220;Why, Mary Cox owes her
life to you&#8211;she actually does <i>this</i> time. Before,
when you and Tom Cameron helped her
out of the water, she acted nasty about it<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush, Jennie!&#8221; commanded Ruth. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
say another word about it. If I had not jumped
into the lake after Mary, somebody else would.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pshaw!&#8221; cried Heavy, &#8220;you can&#8217;t get out
of it that way. And I&#8217;m glad it happened. Now
we <i>shall</i> have a nice time at Lighthouse Point,
for Mary can&#8217;t be anything but fond of you,
child!&#8221;</p>

<p>Ruth, however, had her doubts. She remained
in the stateroom as long as she could after the
<i>Lanawaxa</i> docked. When she was dressed and
came out on the deck the train that took Heavy
and The Fox and the Steeles and Busy Izzy home,
had gone. The train to Cheslow started a few
minutes later.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, Miss Heroine!&#8221; said Tom, grinning
at her as she came out on the deck. &#8220;You
needn&#8217;t be afraid now. Nobody will thank you.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>
I didn&#8217;t hear her say a grateful word myself&#8211;and
I bet <i>you</i> won&#8217;t, either!&#8221;</p>

<p>Helen said nothing at all about The Fox; but
she looked grave. The former president of the
Upedes had influenced Helen a great deal during
this first year at boarding school. Had Ruth
Fielding been a less patient and less faithful
chum, Helen and she would have drifted apart.
And perhaps an occasional sharp speech from
Mercy was what had served more particularly to
show Helen how she was drifting. Now the
lame girl observed:</p>

<p>&#8220;The next time you see Mary Cox fall overboard,
Ruth, I hope you&#8217;ll let her swallow the
whole pond, and walk ashore without your help.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If your name <i>is</i> &#8216;Mercy&#8217; you show none to
either your friends or enemies; do you?&#8221; returned
Ruth, smiling.</p>

<p>The girl from the Red Mill refused to discuss
the matter further, and soon had them all talking
upon a pleasanter theme. It was evening when
they reached Cheslow and Mercy&#8217;s father, of
course, who was the station agent, and Mr. Cameron,
were waiting for them.</p>

<p>The big touring car belonging to the dry-goods
merchant was waiting for the young folk, and
after they had dropped Mercy Curtis at the little
cottage on the by-street, the machine traveled
swiftly across the railroad and out into the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>
suburbs of the town. The Red Mill was five
miles from the railroad station, while the Camerons&#8217;
fine home, &#8220;Outlook,&#8221; stood some distance
beyond.</p>

<p>Before they had gotten out of town, however,
the car was held up in front of a big house set
some distance back from the road, and before
which, on either side of the arched gateway, was
a green lamp. The lamps were already lighted
and as the Cameron car came purring along the
street, with Helen herself under the steering
wheel (for she had begged the privilege of running
it home) a tall figure came hurrying out of
the gateway, signaling them to stop.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Doctor Davison himself!&#8221; cried Ruth,
in some excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;And how are all the Sweetbriars?&#8221; demanded
the good old physician, their staunch friend and
confidant. &#8220;Ah, Tom, my fine fellow! have they
drilled that stoop out of your shoulders?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re all right, Dr. Davison&#8211;and awfully
glad to see you,&#8221; cried Ruth, leaning out of the
tonneau to shake hands with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! here&#8217;s the sunshine of the Red Mill&#8211;and
they&#8217;re needing sunshine there, just now, I
believe,&#8221; said the doctor. &#8220;Did you bring my
Goody Two-Sticks home all right?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s all right, Doctor,&#8221; Helen assured him.
&#8220;And so are we&#8211;only Ruth&#8217;s been in the lake.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>&#8220;In Lake Osago?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir&#8211;and it was wet,&#8221; Tom told him,
grinning.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose she was trying to find that out,&#8221; returned
Dr. Davison. &#8220;Did you get anything
else out of it, Ruthie Fielding?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A girl,&#8221; replied Ruth, rather tartly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh-ho! Well, <i>that</i> was something,&#8221; began
the doctor, when Ruth stopped him with an abrupt
question:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you say that they need me at home,
sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&#8211;honey&#8211;they&#8217;re always glad to have
you there, I reckon,&#8221; said the doctor, slowly.
&#8220;Uncle Jabez and Aunt Alviry will both be glad
to see you<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s trouble, sir; what is it?&#8221; asked Ruth,
gravely, leaning out of the car so as to speak into
his ear. &#8220;There <i>is</i> trouble; isn&#8217;t there? What
is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that I can exactly tell you,
Ruthie,&#8221; he replied, with gravity. &#8220;But it&#8217;s
there. You&#8217;ll see it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aunt Alviry<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it&#8217;s Uncle Jabez?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, my child. It is Uncle Jabez. What it
is you will have to find out, I am afraid, for <i>I</i>
have not been able to,&#8221; said the doctor, in a whisper.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>
&#8220;Maybe it is given to you, my dear, to
straighten out the tangles at the Red Mill.&#8221;</p>

<p>He invited them all down to sample Old
Mammy&#8217;s cakes and lemonade the first pleasant
afternoon, and then the car sped on. But Ruth
was silent. What she might find at the Red
Mill troubled her.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span><a id='link_5'></a>CHAPTER V<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE TINTACKER MINE</span></h2>

<p><span class='sc'>It</span> was too late to more than see the outlines
of the mill and connecting buildings as the car
rushed down the hill toward the river road, between
which and the river itself, and standing on
a knoll, the Red Mill was. Ruth could imagine
just how it looked&#8211;all in dull red paint and clean
white trimmings. Miserly as Jabez Potter was
about many things, he always kept his property
in excellent shape, and the mill and farmhouse,
with the adjoining outbuildings, were painted
every Spring.</p>

<p>A lamp burned in the kitchen; but all else was
dark about the place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t look very lively, Ruth,&#8221; said Tom. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t believe they expect you.&#8221;</p>

<p>But even as he spoke the door opened, and a
broad beam of yellow lamplight shot out across
the porch and down the path. A little, bent figure
was silhouetted in the glow.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Aunt Alviry!&#8221; cried Ruth, in delight.
&#8220;I know <i>she&#8217;s</i> all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All excepting her back and her bones,&#8221; whispered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>
Helen. &#8220;Now, Ruthie! don&#8217;t you let anything
happen to veto our trip to Heavy&#8217;s seaside
cottage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! don&#8217;t suggest such a thing!&#8221; cried her
brother.</p>

<p>But Ruth ran up the path after bidding them
good-night, with her heart fast beating. Dr.
Davison&#8217;s warning had prepared her for almost
any untoward happening.</p>

<p>But Aunt Alvirah only looked delighted to see
the girl as Ruth ran into her arms. Aunt Alvirah
was a friendless old woman whose latter
years would have been spent at the Cheslow Almshouse
had not Jabez Potter taken her to keep
house for him more than ten years before. Ill-natured
people said that the miller had done this
to save paying a housekeeper; but in Aunt Alvirah&#8217;s
opinion it was an instance of Mr. Potter&#8217;s
kindness of heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;You pretty creetur!&#8221; cried Aunt Alvirah,
hugging Ruth close to her. &#8220;And how you&#8217;ve
growed! What a smart girl you are getting to
be! Deary, deary me! how I have longed for
you to git back, Ruthie. Come in! Come in!
Oh, my back and oh, my bones!&#8221; she complained,
under her breath, as she hobbled into the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s the rheumatics, Aunty?&#8221; asked Ruth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just the same, deary. Up one day, and down
the next. Allus will be so, I reckon. I&#8217;d be too
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span>
proud to live if I didn&#8217;t have my aches
and pains&#8211;Oh, my back and oh, my bones!&#8221; as she lowered
herself into her rocker.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Uncle Jabez?&#8221; cried Ruth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sh!&#8221; admonished Aunt Alvirah. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
holler, child. You&#8217;ll disturb him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not <i>sick?</i>&#8221; whispered Ruth, in amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;No&#8211;o. Not sick o&#8217; body, I reckon, child,&#8221;
returned Aunt Alvirah.</p>

<p>&#8220;What <i>is</i> it, Aunt Alviry? What&#8217;s the matter
with him?&#8221; pursued the girl, anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s sick o&#8217; soul, I reckon,&#8221; whispered the
old woman. &#8220;Sumpin&#8217;s gone wrong with him.
You know how Jabez is. It&#8217;s money matters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, has he been robbed again?&#8221; cried Ruth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sh! not jest like that. Not like what Jasper
Parloe did to him. But it&#8217;s jest as bad for Jabez,
I reckon. Anyway, he takes it jest as hard as he
did when his cash-box was lost that time. But
you know how close-mouthed he is, Ruthie. He
won&#8217;t talk about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About <i>what?</i>&#8221; demanded Ruth, earnestly.</p>

<p>Aunt Alvirah rose with difficulty from her chair
and, with her usual murmured complaint of &#8220;Oh,
my back and oh, my bones!&#8221; went to the door
which led to the passage. Off this passage Uncle
Jabez&#8217;s room opened. She closed the door and
hobbled back to her chair, but halted before sitting
down.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>&#8220;I never thought to ask ye, deary,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Ye must be very hungry. Ye ain&#8217;t had no
supper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You sit right down there and keep still,&#8221; said
Ruth, smiling as she removed her coat. &#8220;I guess
I can find something to eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s cocoa. You make you a warm
drink. There&#8217;s plenty of pie and cake&#8211;and
there&#8217;s eggs and ham if you want them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you fret about me,&#8221; repeated Ruth.</p>

<p>&#8220;What makes you so mussed up?&#8221; demanded
Aunt Alvirah, the next moment. &#8220;Why, Ruth
Fielding! have you been in the water?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am. But you know water doesn&#8217;t
hurt me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear child! how reckless you are! Did you
fall in the lake?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Aunty. I jumped in,&#8221; returned the girl,
and then told her briefly about her adventure on
the <i>Lanawaxa</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Goodness me! Goodness me!&#8221; exclaimed
Aunt Alvirah. &#8220;Whatever would your uncle say
if he knew about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what is the matter with Uncle Jabez?&#8221;
demanded Ruth, sitting down at the end of the
table to eat her &#8220;bite.&#8221; &#8220;You haven&#8217;t told me
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I &#8217;lowed to do so,&#8221; sighed the old woman.
&#8220;But I don&#8217;t want him to hear us a-gossipin&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>
about it. You know how Jabez is. I dunno as
he knows <i>I</i> know what I know<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That sounds just like a riddle, Aunt Alvirah!&#8221;
laughed Ruth.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I reckon it <i>is</i> a riddle,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I
only know from piecin&#8217; this, that, and t&#8217;other together;
but I reckon I fin&#8217;ly got it pretty straight
about the Tintacker Mine&#8211;and your uncle&#8217;s lost
a power o&#8217; money by it, Ruthie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the Tintacker Mine?&#8221; demanded
Ruth, in wonder.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a silver mine. I dunno where it is, &#8217;ceptin&#8217;
it&#8217;s fur out West and that your uncle put a lot of
money into it and he can&#8217;t git it out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Cause it&#8217;s busted, I reckon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The mine&#8217;s &#8216;busted&#8217;&#8221; repeated the puzzled
Ruth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Or so I s&#8217;pect. I&#8217;ll tell ye how it come
about. The feller come along here not long
after you went to school last Fall, Ruthie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What fellow?&#8221; asked Ruth, trying to get at
the meat in the nut, for Aunt Alvirah was very
discursive.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, you lemme tell it my own way,
Ruthie,&#8221; admonished the old woman. &#8220;You
would better,&#8221; and the girl laughed, and nodded.
&#8220;It was one day when I was sweepin&#8217; the sittin&#8217;
room&#8211;ye know, what Mercy Curtis had for her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>
bedroom while she was out here last Summer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ruth nodded again encouragingly, and the little
old woman went on in her usual rambling
way:</p>

<p>&#8220;I was a-sweepin&#8217;, as I say, and Jabez come
by and put his head in at the winder. &#8216;That&#8217;s
too hard for ye, Alviry,&#8217; says he. &#8216;Let the dust
be&#8211;it ain&#8217;t eatin&#8217; nothin&#8217;.&#8217; Jest like a man, ye
know!</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well,&#8217; says I, &#8216;if I didn&#8217;t sweep onc&#8217;t in a
while, Jabez, we&#8217;d be wadin&#8217; to our boot-tops in
dirt.&#8217; Like that, ye know, Ruthie. And he says,
&#8216;They hev things nowadays for suckin&#8217; up the
dirt, instead of kickin&#8217; it up that-a-way,&#8217; and
with that a voice says right in the yard, &#8216;You&#8217;re
right there, Mister. An&#8217; I got one of &#8217;em here
to sell ye.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;There was a young feller in the yard with a
funny lookin&#8217; rig-a-ma-jig in his hand, and his
hat on the back of his head, and lookin&#8217; jest as
busy as a toad that&#8217;s swallered a hornet. My!
you wouldn&#8217;t think that feller had a minnit ter
stay, the way he acted. Scurcely had time to sell
Jabez one of them &#8216;Vac-o-jacs,&#8217; as he called &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A vacuum cleaner!&#8221; exclaimed Ruth.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s something like it. Only it was like a
carpet-sweeper, too. I seen pitchers of &#8217;em in the
back of a magazine onc&#8217;t. I never b&#8217;lieved they
was for more&#8217;n ornament; but that spry young
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>
feller come in and worked it for me, and he sucked
up the dust out o&#8217; that ingrain carpet till ye
couldn&#8217;t beat a particle out o&#8217; it with an ox-goad!</p>

<p>&#8220;But I didn&#8217;t seem ter favor that Vac-o-jac
none,&#8221; continued Aunt Alvirah. &#8220;Ye know how
close-grained yer Uncle is. I don&#8217;t expect him
ter buy no fancy fixin&#8217;s for an ol&#8217; creetur like me.
But at noon time he come in and set one o&#8217; the
machines in the corner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He bought it!&#8221; cried Ruth.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what he done. He says, &#8216;Alviry, ef
it&#8217;s any good to ye, there it is! I calkerlate that&#8217;s
a smart young man. He got five dollars out o&#8217;
me easier than <i>I</i> ever got five dollars out of a
man in all my days.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell ye truthful, Ruthie! I can&#8217;t use it by
myself. It works too hard for anybody that&#8217;s
got my back and bones. But Ben, he comes in
once in a while and works it for me. I reckon
your uncle sends him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Aunt Alviry!&#8221; cried Ruth. &#8220;What
about the Tintacker Mine? You haven&#8217;t told me
a thing about <i>that</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m a-comin&#8217; to it,&#8221; declared the old
woman. &#8220;It&#8217;s all of a piece&#8211;that and the Vac-o-jac.
I seen the same young feller that sold
Jabez the sweeper hangin&#8217; about the mill a good
bit. And nights Jabez figgered up his accounts
and counted his money till &#8217;way long past midnight
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>
sometimes. Bimeby he says to me, one
day:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Alviry, that Vac-o-jac works all right;
don&#8217;t it?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to tell him it was hard to work,
and it does take up the dirt, so I says &#8216;Yes.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Then I reckon I&#8217;ll give the boy the benefit
of the doubt, and say he&#8217;s honest,&#8217; says Jabez.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know what he meant, and I didn&#8217;t
ask. &#8217;Twouldn&#8217;t be <i>my</i> place ter ask Jabez Potter
his business&#8211;you know that, Ruthie. So I
jest watched and in a day or two back come the
young sweeper feller again, and we had him to
dinner. This was long before Thanksgivin&#8217;.
They sat at the table after dinner and I heard
&#8217;em talking about the mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah-ha!&#8221; exclaimed Ruth, with a smile.
&#8220;Now we come to the mine, do we?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you it was all of a piece,&#8221; said Aunt
Alvirah, complacently. &#8220;Well, it seemed that
the boy&#8217;s father&#8211;this agent warn&#8217;t more than a
boy, but maybe he was a sharper, jest the same&#8211;the
boy&#8217;s father and another man found the mine.
Prospected for it, did they say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is probably the word,&#8221; agreed Ruth,
much interested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, anyhow, they found it and got out
some silver. Then the boy&#8217;s father bought out
the other man. Then he stopped finding silver in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span>
it. And then he died, and left the mine to his
folks. But the boy went out there and rummaged
around the mine and found that there was still
plenty of silver, only it had to be treated&#8211;or put
through something&#8211;a pro&#8211;a prospect<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Process?&#8221; suggested Ruth.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it, deary. Some process to refine the
silver, or git it out of the ore, or something. It
was all about chemicals and machinery, and all
that. Your Uncle Jabez seemed to understand
it, but it was all Dutch to me,&#8221; declared Aunt Alvirah.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; continued the old woman, &#8220;the Tintacker
Mine, as the feller called it, couldn&#8217;t be
made to pay without machinery being bought, and
all that. He had to take in a partner, he said.
And I jedge your Uncle Jabez bought into the
mine. Now, for all I kin hear, there ain&#8217;t no
mine, or no silver, or no nothin&#8217;. Leastwise, the
young feller can&#8217;t be heard from, and Jabez has
lost his money&#8211;and a big sum it is, Ruthie. It&#8217;s
hurt him so that he&#8217;s got smaller and smaller than
ever. Begrudges the very vittles we have on the
table, I believe. I&#8217;m afraid, deary, that unless
there&#8217;s a change he won&#8217;t want you to keep on at
that school you&#8217;re going to, it&#8217;s so expensive,&#8221; and
Aunt Alvirah gathered the startled girl into her
arms and rocked her to and fro on her bosom.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I was comin&#8217; to, deary,&#8221; she
sobbed. &#8220;I had ter tell ye; he told me I must.
Ye can&#8217;t go back to Briarwood, Ruthie, when it
comes Fall.&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span><a id='link_6'></a>CHAPTER VI<br /><span class='h2fs'>UNCLE JABEZ AT HIS WORST</span></h2>

<p><span class='sc'>It</span> was true that Mr. Potter had promised Ruth
only one year at school. The miller considered
he owed his grand-niece something for finding and
restoring to him his cash-box which he had lost,
and which contained considerable money and the
stocks and bonds in which he had invested. Jabez
Potter prided himself on being strictly honest.
He was just according to his own notion. He
owed Ruth something for what she had done&#8211;something
more than her &#8220;board and keep&#8221;&#8211;and
he had paid the debt. Or, so he considered.</p>

<p>There had been a time when Uncle Jabez
seemed to be less miserly. His hard old heart
had warmed toward his niece&#8211;or, so Ruth believed.
And he had taken a deep interest&#8211;for
him&#8211;in Mercy Curtis, the lame girl. Ruth
knew that Uncle Jabez and Dr. Davison together
had made it possible for Mercy to attend Briarwood
Hall. Of course, Uncle Jabez would cut
off that charity as well, and the few tears Ruth
cried that night after she went to bed were as
much for Mercy&#8217;s disappointment as for her
own.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>&#8220;But maybe Dr. Davison will assume the entire
cost of keeping Mercy at school,&#8221; thought the
girl of the Red Mill. &#8220;Or, perhaps, Mr. Curtis
may have paid the debts he contracted while
Mercy was so ill, and will be able to help pay her
expenses at Briarwood.&#8221;</p>

<p>But about herself she could have no such hope.
She knew that the cost of her schooling had been
considerable. Nor had Uncle Jabez, been niggardly
with her about expenditures. He had given
her a ten-dollar bill for spending money at the beginning
of each half; and twice during the school
year had sent her an extra five-dollar bill. Her
board and tuition for the year had cost over three
hundred dollars; it would cost more the coming
year. If Uncle Jabez had actually lost money in
this Tintacker Mine Ruth could be sure that he
meant what he had left to Aunt Alvirah to tell
her. He would not pay for another school year.</p>

<p>But Ruth was a persevering little body and she
came of determined folk. She had continued at
the district school when the circumstances were
much against her. Now, having had a taste of
Briarwood for one year, she was the more anxious
to keep on for three years more. Besides, there
was the vision of college beyond! She knew that
if she remained at home, all she could look forward
to was to take Aunt Alvirah&#8217;s place as her
uncle&#8217;s housekeeper. She would have no chance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>
to get ahead in life. Life at the Red Mill seemed
a very narrow outlook indeed.</p>

<p>Ruth meant to get an education. Somehow
(there were ten long weeks of Summer vacation
before her) she must think up a scheme for earning
the money necessary to pay for her second
year&#8217;s tuition. Three hundred and fifty dollars!
that was a great, great sum for a girl of Ruth
Fielding&#8217;s years to attempt to earn. How should
she &#8220;begin to go about it&#8221;? It looked an impossible
task.</p>

<p>But Ruth possessed a fund of good sense. She
was practical, if imaginative, and she was just
sanguine enough to keep her temper sweet.
Lying awake and worrying over it wasn&#8217;t going
to do her a bit of good; she knew that. Therefore
she did not indulge herself long, but wiped
away her tears, snuggled down into the pillow,
and dropped asleep.</p>

<p>In the morning she saw Uncle Jabez when she
came down stairs. The stove smoked and he
was growling about it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning, Uncle!&#8221; she cried and ran to
him and threw her arms around his neck and
kissed him&#8211;whether he would be kissed, or not!</p>

<p>&#8220;There! there! so you&#8217;re home; are you?&#8221; he
growled.</p>

<p>Ruth was glad to notice that he called it her
<i>home</i>. She knew that he did not want a word to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>
be said about what Aunt Alvirah had told her
over night, and she set about smoothing matters
over in her usual way.</p>

<p>&#8220;You go on and &#8217;tend to your outside chores,
Uncle,&#8221; she commanded. &#8220;I&#8217;ll build this fire in
a jiffy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! I reckon you&#8217;ve forgotten how to build
a kitchen fire&#8211;livin&#8217; so long in a steam-heated
room,&#8221; he grunted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, don&#8217;t you believe that!&#8221; she assured
him, and running out to the shed for a handful of
fat-pine, or &#8220;lightwood,&#8221; soon had the stove
roaring comfortably.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a comfort you be, my pretty creetur,&#8221;
sighed Aunt Alvirah, as she hobbled down stairs.
&#8220;Oh, my back and oh, my bones! This is going
to be a <i>creaky day</i>. I feel the dampness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you believe it, Aunty!&#8221; cried the girl.
&#8220;The sun&#8217;s going to come out and drive away
every atom of this mist. Cheer up!&#8221;</p>

<p>And she was that way all day; but deep down
in her heart there was a very tender spot indeed,
and in her mind the thought of giving up Briarwood
rankled like a barbed arrow. She would
<i>not</i> give it up if she could help. But how ever
could she earn three hundred and fifty dollars?
The idea seemed preposterous.</p>

<p>Aside from being with Aunt Alvirah, and helping
her, Ruth&#8217;s homecoming was not at all as she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>
had hoped it would be. Uncle Jabez was more
taciturn than ever, it seemed to the girl. She
could not break through the crust of his manner.
If she followed him to the mill, he was too busy
to talk, or the grinding-stones made so much noise
that talking was impossible. At night he did not
even remain in the kitchen to count up the day&#8217;s
gains and to study his accounts. Instead, he retired
with the cash-box and ledger to his own
room.</p>

<p>She found no opportunity of opening any discussion
about Briarwood, or about the mysterious
Tintacker Mine, upon which subject Aunt Alvirah
had been so voluble. If the old man had
lost money in the scheme, he was determined to
give her no information at first hand about it.</p>

<p>At first she was doubtful whether she should
go to Lighthouse Point. Indeed, she was not
sure that she <i>could</i> go. She had no money. But
before the week was out at dinner one day Uncle
Jabez pushed a twenty-dollar bill across the table
to her, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I said ye should go down there to the seaside
for a spell, Ruth. Make that money do ye,&#8221;
and before she could either thank him or refuse
the money, Uncle Jabez stumped out of the house.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Helen drove over in the pony
carriage to take Ruth to town, so the latter could
assure her chum that she would go to Lighthouse
Point and be one of Jennie Stone&#8217;s bungalow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>
party. They called on Dr. Davison and the girl
from the Red Mill managed to get a word in private
with the first friend she had made on her arrival
at Cheslow (barring Tom Cameron&#8217;s
mastiff, Reno) and told him of conditions as she
had found them at home.</p>

<p>&#8220;So, it looks as though I had got to make my
own way through school, Doctor, and it troubles
me a whole lot,&#8221; Ruth said to the grave physician.
&#8220;But what bothers me, too, is Mercy<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about Goody Two-Sticks,&#8221; returned
the doctor, quickly. &#8220;Your uncle served
notice on me a week before you came home that
he could not help to put her through Briarwood
beyond this term that is closed. I told him he
needn&#8217;t bother. Sam Curtis is in better shape
than he was, and we&#8217;ll manage to find the money
to put that sharp little girl of his where she can
get all the education she can possibly soak in.
But you, Ruth<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to find a way, too,&#8221; declared Ruth,
independently, yet secretly feeling much less confidence
than she appeared to have.</p>

<p>Mercy was all ready for the seaside party
when the girls called at the Curtis cottage. The
lame girl was in her summer house, sewing and
singing softly to herself. She no longer glared
at the children as they ran by, or shook her fist
at them as she used to, because they could dance
and she could not.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>On Monday they would start for the shore,
meeting Heavy and the others on the train, and
spending a good part of the day riding to Lighthouse
Point. Mr. Cameron had exercised his influence
with certain railroad officials and obtained
a private car for the young folk. The Cameron
twins and Ruth and Mercy would get aboard the
car at Cheslow, and Jennie Stone and her other
guests would join them at Jennie&#8217;s home town.</p>

<p>Between that day and the time of her departure
Ruth tried to get closer to Uncle Jabez; but the
miller went about with lowering brow and scarcely
spoke to either Ruth or Aunt Alvirah.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s jest as well ye air goin&#8217; away again so
quick, my pretty,&#8221; said the old woman, sadly.
&#8220;When Jabez gits one o&#8217; these moods on him
there ain&#8217;t nobody understands him so well as me.
I don&#8217;t mind if he don&#8217;t speak. I talk right out
loud what I have to say an&#8217; he can hear an&#8217; reply,
or hear an&#8217; keep dumb, jest whichever he
likes. They say &#8216;hard words don&#8217;t break no
bones&#8217; an&#8217; sure enough bein&#8217; as dumb as an oyster
ain&#8217;t hurtin&#8217; none, either. You go &#8217;long an&#8217;
have your fun with your mates, Ruthie. Mebbe
Jabez will be over his grouch when you come
back.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Ruth was afraid that the miller would
change but little unless there was first an emphatic
betterment in the affairs of the Tintacker Mine.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span><a id='link_7'></a>CHAPTER VII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE SIGNAL GUN</span></h2>

<p><span class='sc'>The</span> train did not slow down for Sandtown until
after mid-afternoon, and when the party of
young folk alighted from the private car there
were still five miles of heavy roads between them
and Lighthouse Point. It had been pleasant
enough when Ruth Fielding and her companions
left Cheslow, far up in New York State; but now
to the south and east the heavens were masked by
heavy, lead-colored clouds, and the wind came
from the sea in wild, rain-burdened gusts.</p>

<p>&#8220;My! how sharp it is!&#8221; cried Ruth. &#8220;And
it&#8217;s salt!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The salt&#8217;s in the air&#8211;especially when there
is a storm at sea,&#8221; explained Heavy. &#8220;And I
guess we&#8217;ve landed just in time to see a gale. I
hope it won&#8217;t last long and spoil our good time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but to see the ocean in a storm&#8211;that
will be great!&#8221; cried Madge Steele.</p>

<p>The Stones&#8217; house had been open for some
days and there were two wagons in readiness for
the party. The three boys and the baggage went
in one, while the five girls crowded into the other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>
and both wagons were driven promptly toward
the shore.</p>

<p>The girls were just as eager as they could be,
and chattered like magpies. All but Mary Cox.
She had been much unlike her usual self all day.
When she had joined the party in the private car
that morning, Ruth noticed that The Fox looked
unhappy. Her eyes were swollen as though she
had been weeping and she had very little to say.</p>

<p>For one thing Ruth was really thankful. The
Fox said nothing to her about the accident on the
<i>Lanawaxa</i>. She may have been grateful for
Ruth&#8217;s timely assistance when she fell into Lake
Osago; but she succeeded in effectually hiding her
gratitude.</p>

<p>Heavy, however, confided to Ruth that Mary
had found sore trouble at home when she returned
from Briarwood. Her father had died the year
before and left his business affairs in a tangle.
Mary&#8217;s older brother, John, had left college and
set about straightening out matters. And now
something serious had happened to John. He
had gone away on business and for weeks his
mother had heard nothing from him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know but Mary would give up coming
with us&#8211;just as Lluella and Belle did,&#8221; said
the stout girl. &#8220;But there is nothing she can do at
home, and I urged her to come. We must all
try to make it particularly pleasant for her.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>Ruth was perfectly willing to do her share; but
one can scarcely make it pleasant for a person
who refuses to speak to one. And the girl from
the Red Mill could not help feeling that The Fox
had done her best to make <i>her</i> withdraw from
Jennie Stone&#8217;s party.</p>

<p>The sea was not in sight until the wagons had
been driven more than half the distance to the
Stone bungalow. Then, suddenly rounding a
sandy hill, they saw the wide sweep of the ocean
in the distance, and the small and quieter harbor
on the inviting shore of which the bungalow was
built.</p>

<p>Out upon the far point of this nearer sandy
ridge was built the white shaft of the Sokennet
Light. Sokennet village lay upon the other side
of the harbor. On this side a few summer homes
had been erected, and beyond the lighthouse was
a low, wind-swept building which Heavy told the
girls was the life saving station.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have lots of fun down there. Cap&#8217;n
Abinadab Cope is just the nicest old man you
ever saw!&#8221; declared Heavy. &#8220;And he can tell
the most thrilling stories of wrecks along the
coast. And there&#8217;s the station &#8216;day book&#8217; that
records everything they do, from the number of
pounds of coal and gallons of kerosene used each
day, to how they save whole shiploads of people<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>&#8220;Let&#8217;s ask him to save a shipload for our
especial benefit,&#8221; laughed Madge. &#8220;I suppose
there&#8217;s only one wreck in fifteen or twenty years,
hereabout.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing of the kind! Sometimes there are a
dozen in one winter. And lots of times the surfmen
go off in a boat and save ships from being
wrecked. In a fog, you know. Ships get lost in
a fog sometimes, just as folks get lost in a forest<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or in a blizzard,&#8221; cried Helen, with a lively
remembrance of their last winter&#8217;s experience at
Snow Camp.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing like that will happen here, you
know,&#8221; said Ruth, laughing. &#8220;Heavy promised
that we shouldn&#8217;t be lost in a snowstorm at Lighthouse
Point.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But hear the sea roar!&#8221; murmured Mary
Cox. &#8220;Oh! look at the waves!&#8221;</p>

<p>They had now come to where they could see
the surf breaking over a ledge, or reef, off the
shore some half-mile. The breakers piled up as
high&#8211;seemingly&#8211;as a tall house; and when they
burst upon the rock they completely hid it for the
time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ever see such a sight!&#8221; cried Madge.
&#8220;&#8216;The sea in its might&#8217;!&#8221;</p>

<p>The gusts of rain came more plentifully as they
rode on, and so rough did the wind become, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span>
girls were rather glad when the wagons drove in
at the gateway of the Stone place.</p>

<p>Immediately around the house the owner had
coaxed some grass to grow&#8211;at an expense, so
Jennie said, of about &#8220;a dollar a blade.&#8221; But
everywhere else was the sand&#8211;cream-colored,
yellow, gray and drab, or slate where the water
washed over it and left it glistening.</p>

<p>The entrance was at the rear; the bungalow
faced the cove, standing on a ridge which&#8211;as has
been before said&#8211;continued far out to the lighthouse.</p>

<p>&#8220;And a woman keeps the light. Her husband
kept it for many, many years; but he died a year
ago and the government has continued her as
keeper. She&#8217;s a nice old lady, is Mother Purling,
and she can tell stories, too, that will make your
hair curl!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going over there right away,&#8221; declared
Mary, who had begun to be her old self again.
&#8220;Mine is as straight as an Indian&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A woman alone in a lighthouse! isn&#8217;t that
great?&#8221; cried Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is alone sometimes; but there is an assistant
keeper. His name is Crab&#8211;and that&#8217;s what
he is!&#8221; declared Heavy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I can see right now that we&#8217;re going to
have great fun here,&#8221; observed Madge.</p>

<p>This final conversation was carried on after
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>
the girls had run into the house for shelter from
a sharp gust of rain, and had been taken upstairs
by their hostess to the two big rooms in the front
of the bungalow which they were to sleep in.
From the windows they could see across the cove
to the village and note all the fishing and pleasure
boats bobbing at their moorings.</p>

<p>Right below them was a long dock built out
from Mr. Stone&#8217;s property, and behind it was
moored a motor-launch, a catboat, and two rowboats&#8211;quite
a little fleet.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, there isn&#8217;t a sail in the harbor&#8211;nor
outside. That shows that the storm now blowing
up is bound to be a stiff one,&#8221; explained Heavy.
&#8220;For the fishermen of Sokennet are as daring as
any on the coast, and I have often seen them run
out to the banks into what looked to be the very
teeth of a gale!&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the boys had been shown to a good-sized
room at the back of the house, and they were
already down again and outside, breasting the intermittent
squalls from the sea. They had no
curls and furbelows to arrange, and ran all about
the place before dinner time.</p>

<p>But ere that time arrived the night had shut
down. The storm clouds hung low and threatened
a heavy rainfall at any moment. Off on the
horizon was a livid streak which seemed to divide
the heavy ocean from the wind-thrashed clouds.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>The company that gathered about the dinner
table was a lively one, even if the wind did shriek
outside and the thunder of the surf kept up a continual
accompaniment to their conversation&#8211;like
the deeper notes of a mighty organ. Mr. Stone,
himself, was not present; but one of Heavy&#8217;s
young aunts had come down to oversee the party,
and she was no wet blanket upon the fun.</p>

<p>Of course, the &#8220;goodies&#8221; on the table were
many. Trust Heavy for that. The old black
cook, who had been in the Stone family for a generation,
doted on the stout girl and would cook
all day to please her young mistress.</p>

<p>They had come to the dessert course when
suddenly Tom Cameron half started from his
chair and held up a hand for silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Tommy?&#8221; demanded
Busy Izzy, inquisitively. &#8220;What do you hear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen!&#8221; commanded Tom.</p>

<p>The hilarity ceased suddenly, and all those at
the table listened intently. The sudden hush
made the noise of the elements seem greater.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you hear?&#8221; finally asked his sister.</p>

<p>&#8220;A gun&#8211;there!&#8221;</p>

<p>A distant, reverberating sound was repeated.
They all heard it. Heavy and her aunt, Miss
Kate, glanced at each other with sudden comprehension.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; Ruth cried.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s a signal gun,&#8221; Heavy said, rather weakly.</p>

<p>&#8220;A ship in distress,&#8221; explained Miss Kate, and
her tone hushed their clamor.</p>

<p>A third time the report sounded. The dining
room door opened and the butler entered.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, Maxwell?&#8221; asked Miss Kate.</p>

<p>&#8220;A ship on the Second Reef, Miss,&#8221; he said
hurriedly. &#8220;She was sighted just before dark,
driving in. But it was plain that she was helpless,
and had gone broadside on to the rock.
She&#8217;ll break up before morning, the fishermen
say. It will be an awful wreck, ma&#8217;am, for there
is no chance of the sea going down.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span><a id='link_8'></a>CHAPTER VIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE LIFEBOAT IS LAUNCHED</span></h2>

<p><span class='sc'>The</span> announcement quelled all the jollity of the
party on the instant. Heavy even lost interest in
the sweetmeats before her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Goodness me! what a terrible thing,&#8221; cried
Helen Cameron. &#8220;A ship on the rocks!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go see it!&#8221; Busy Izzy cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we can,&#8221; said Tom. &#8220;Is it possible, Miss
Kate?&#8221;</p>

<p>Heavy&#8217;s aunt looked at the butler for information.
He was one of those well-trained servants
who make it their business to know everything.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can have the ponies put into the long buckboard.
The young ladies can drive to the station;
the young gentlemen can walk. It is not
raining very hard at present.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mercy elected to remain in the house with Miss
Kate. The other girls were just as anxious to
go to the beach as the boys. There were no
timid ones in the party.</p>

<p>But when they came down, dressed in rainy-weather
garments, and saw the man standing at
the ponies&#8217; heads, glistening in wet rubber, if one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>
had withdrawn probably all would have given up
the venture. The boys had already gone on
ahead, and the ship&#8217;s gun sounded mournfully
through the wild night, at short intervals.</p>

<p>They piled into the three seats of the buckboard,
Ruth sitting beside the driver. The ponies
dashed away along the sandy road. It was two
miles to the life saving station. They passed the
three boys when they were only half way to their
destination.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell &#8217;em not to save all the people from the
wreck till we get there!&#8221; shouted Tom Cameron.</p>

<p>None of the visitors to Lighthouse Point realized
the seriousness of the happening as yet.
They were yet to see for the first time a good
ship battering her life out against the cruel rocks.</p>

<p>Nor did the girls see the wreck at first, for a
pall of darkness lay upon the sea. There were
lights in the station and a huge fire of driftwood
burned on the beach. Around this they saw figures
moving, and Heavy said, as she alighted:</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll go right down there. There are some
women and children already&#8211;see? Sam will put
the horses under the shed here.&#8221;</p>

<p>The five girls locked arms and ran around the
station. When they came to the front of the
building, a great door was wheeled back at one
side and men in oilskins were seen moving about
a boat in the shed. The lifeboat was on a truck
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>
and they were just getting ready to haul her down
to the beach.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the wreck must have struck nearly an
hour ago!&#8221; cried Madge. &#8220;How slow they
are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Heavy thoughtfully. &#8220;It is July
now, and Uncle Sam doesn&#8217;t believe there will be
any wrecks along this coast until September. In
the summer Cap&#8217;n Abinadab keeps the station
alone. It took some time to-night to find a crew&#8211;and possibly
some of these men are volunteers.&#8221;</p>

<p>But now that the life-savers had got on the
ground, they went to work with a briskness and
skill that impressed the onlookers. They tailed
onto the drag rope and hauled the long, glistening
white boat down to the very edge of the sea. The
wind was directly onshore, and it was a fight to
stand against it, let alone to haul such a heavy
truck through the wet sand.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a glow at sea and the gun
boomed out again. Then a pale signal light
burned on the deck of the foundered vessel. As
the light grew those ashore could see her lower
rigging and the broken masts and spars. She lay
over toward the shore and her deck seemed a snarl
of lumber. Between the reef and the beach, too,
the water was a-foul with wreckage and planks
of all sizes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>&#8220;Lumber-laden, boys&#8211;and her deck load&#8217;s
broke loose!&#8221; shouted one man.</p>

<p>The surf roared in upon the sands, and then
sucked out again with a whine which made Ruth
shudder. The sea seemed like some huge, ravening
beast eager for its prey.</p>

<p>&#8220;How can they ever launch the boat into those
waves?&#8221; Ruth asked of Heavy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, they know how,&#8221; returned the stout girl.</p>

<p>But the life-savers were in conference about
their captain. He was a short, sturdy old man
with a squarely trimmed &#8220;paint-brush&#8221; beard.
The girls drew nearer to the group and heard one
of the surfmen say:</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll smash her, Cap, sure as you&#8217;re born!
Those planks are charging in like battering-rams.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll try it, Mason,&#8221; returned Cap&#8217;n Abinadab.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe we can shoot a line to her
against this gale. Ready!&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain got in at the stern and the others
took their places in the boat. Each man had a
cork belt strapped around his body under his arms.
There were a dozen other men to launch the lifeboat
into the surf when the captain gave the
word.</p>

<p>He stood up and watched the breakers rolling
in. As a huge one curved over and broke in a
smother of foam and spray he shouted some command
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>
which the helpers understood. The boat
started, truck and all, and immediately the men
launching her were waist deep in the surging, hissing
sea.</p>

<p>The returning billow carried the boat off the
truck, and the lifeboatmen plunged in their oars
and pulled. Their short sharp strokes were in
such unison that the men seemed moved by the
same mind. The long boat shot away from the
beach and mounted the incoming wave like a
cork.</p>

<p>The men ashore drew back the boat-truck out
of the way. The lifeboat seemed to hang on
that wave as though hesitating to take the plunge.
Ruth thought that it would be cast back&#8211;a wreck
itself&#8211;upon the beach.</p>

<p>But suddenly it again sprang forward, and the
curling surf hid boat and men for a full minute
from the gaze of those on shore. The girls clung
together and gazed eagerly out into the shifting
shadows that overspread the riotous sea.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve sunk!&#8221; gasped Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; cried Heavy. &#8220;There! see
them?&#8221;</p>

<p>The boat&#8217;s bow rose to meet the next wave.
They saw the men pulling as steadily as though
the sea were smooth. Old Cap&#8217;n Abinadab still
stood upright in the stern, grasping the heavy
steering oar.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ve read,&#8221; said Ruth, more quietly, &#8220;that
these lifeboats are unsinkable&#8211;unless they are
completely wrecked. Water-tight compartments,
you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, Miss,&#8221; said one of the men
nearby. &#8220;She can&#8217;t sink. But she can be
smashed&#8211;Ah!&#8221;</p>

<p>A shout came back to them from the sea. The
wind whipped the cry past them in a most eerie
fashion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cap&#8217;n Abinadab shouting to the men,&#8221; explained
Heavy, breathlessly.</p>

<p>Suddenly another signal light was touched off
upon the wreck. The growing light flickered over
the entire expanse of lumber-littered sea between
the reef and the beach. They could see the lifeboat
more clearly.</p>

<p>She rose and sank, rose and sank, upon wave
after wave, all the time fighting her way out from
the shore. Again and again they heard the awesome
cry. The captain was warning his men how
to pull to escape the charging timbers.</p>

<p>The next breaker that rolled in brought with
it several great planks that were dashed upon the
beach with fearful force. The splinters flew into
the air, the wind whipping them across the sands.
The anxious spectators had to dodge.</p>

<p>The timbers ground together as the sea sucked
them back. Again and again they were rolled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>
in the surf, splintering against each other savagely.</p>

<p>&#8220;One of those would go through that boat
like she was made of paper!&#8221; bawled one of
the fishermen.</p>

<p>At that moment they saw the lifeboat lifted
upon another huge wave. She was a full cable&#8217;s
length from the shore, advancing very slowly.
In the glare of the Coston light the anxious spectators
saw her swerve to port to escape a huge
timber which charged upon her.</p>

<p>The girls screamed. The great stick struck
the lifeboat a glancing blow. In an instant she
swung broadside to the waves, and then rolled
over and over in the trough of the sea.</p>

<p>A chorus of shouts and groans went up from
the crowd on shore. The lifeboat and her courageous
crew had disappeared.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span><a id='link_9'></a>CHAPTER IX<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE GIRL IN THE RIGGING</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;<span class='sc'>Oh</span>! isn&#8217;t it awful!&#8221; cried Helen, clinging
to Ruth Fielding. &#8220;I wish I hadn&#8217;t come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re lost!&#8221; quavered Mary Cox.
&#8220;They&#8217;re drowned!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Heavy was more practical. &#8220;They can&#8217;t
drown so easily&#8211;with those cork-vests on &#8217;em.
There! the boat&#8217;s righted.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a fact. Much nearer the shore, it was
true, but the lifeboat was again right side up.
They saw the men creep in over her sides and
seize the oars which had been made fast to her
so that they could not be lost.</p>

<p>But the lifeboat was not so buoyant, and it was
plain that she had been seriously injured. Cap&#8217;n
Abinadab dared not go on to the wreck.</p>

<p>&#8220;That timber mashed her in for&#8217;ard,&#8221; declared
a fisherman standing near the girls.
&#8220;They&#8217;ve got to give it up this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t steer in such a clutter of wreckage,&#8221;
declared another. &#8220;Not with an oared boat.
She ought to be a motor. Every other station
on this coast, from Macklin to Cape Brender,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>
has a lifeboat driven by a motor. Sokennet allus
has to take other folks&#8217; leavin&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helplessly the lifeboat drifted shoreward.
The girls watched her, almost holding their
breath with excitement. The three boys raced
down to the beach now and joined them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Crickey!&#8221; yelped little Isadore Phelps.
&#8220;We&#8217;re almost too late to see the fun!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; commanded Ruth, sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your idea of fun, young man, is very much
warped,&#8221; Madge Steele added.</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t they got the wrecked people off?&#8221;
demanded Tom, in wonder.</p>

<p>At the moment an added Coston burned up
on the wreck. Its uncertain glare revealed the
shrouds and torn lower rigging. They saw several
figures&#8211;outlined in the glaring light&#8211;lashed
to the stays and broken spars. The craft was
a schooner, lumber-laden, and the sea had now
cast her so far over on her beam-ends that her
deck was like a wall confronting the shore.
Against this background the crew were visible,
clinging desperately to hand-holds, or lashed to
the rigging.</p>

<p>And a great cry went suddenly up from the
crowd ashore. &#8220;There&#8217;s women aboard her&#8211;poor
lost souls!&#8221; quavered one old dame who
had seen many a terrifying wreck along the
coast.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>Ruth Fielding&#8217;s sharper eyes had discovered
that one of the figures clinging to the wreck was
too small for a grown person.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a child!&#8221; she murmured. &#8220;It&#8217;s a girl.
Oh, Helen! there&#8217;s a girl&#8211;no older than we&#8211;on
that wreck!&#8221;</p>

<p>The words of the men standing about them
proved Ruth&#8217;s statement to be true. Others had
descried the girl&#8217;s figure in that perilous situation.
There was a woman, too, and seven men. Seven
men were ample to man a schooner of her size,
and probably the other two were the captain&#8217;s
wife and daughter.</p>

<p>But if escape to the shore depended upon the
work of the lifeboat and her crew, the castaways
were in peril indeed, for the boat was coming
shoreward now with a rush. With her came the
tossing, charging timbers washed from the deck
load. The sea between the reef and the beach
was now a seething mass of broken and splintering
planks and beams. No craft could live in such
a seaway.</p>

<p>But Ruth and her friends were suddenly conscious
of a peril nearer at hand. The broken
lifeboat with its crew was being swept shoreward
upon a great wave, and with the speed of an
express train. The great, curling, foam-streaked
breaker seemed to hurl the heavy boat through
the air.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>&#8220;They&#8217;ll be killed! Oh, they will!&#8221; shrieked
Mary Cox.</p>

<p>The long craft, half-smothered in foam, and
accompanied by the plunging timbers from the
wreck, darted shoreward with increasing velocity.
One moment it was high above their heads,
with the curling wave ready to break, and the
sea sucking away beneath its keel&#8211;bared for
half its length.</p>

<p>Crash! Down the boat was dashed, with a
blow that (so it seemed to the unaccustomed spectators)
must tear it asunder.</p>

<p>The crew were dashed from their places by
the shock. The waiting longshoremen ran to
seize the broken boat and drag it above high-water
mark. One of the crew was sucked back
with the undertow and disappeared for a full
minute. But he came in, high on the next wave,
and they caught and saved him.</p>

<p>To the amazement of Ruth Fielding and her
young companions, none of the seven men who
had manned the boat seemed much the worse for
their experience. They breathed heavily and
their faces were grim. She could almost have
sworn that the youngest of the crew&#8211;he had
the figure &#8220;6&#8221; worked on the sleeve of his coat&#8211;had
tears of disappointment in his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a desperate shame, lads!&#8221; croaked old
Cap&#8217;n Abinadab. &#8220;We&#8217;re bested. And the old
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>
boat&#8217;s badly smashed. But there&#8217;s one thing
sure&#8211;no other boat, nor no other crew, couldn&#8217;t
do what we started to do. Ain&#8217;t no kick comin&#8217;
on that score.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And can&#8217;t the poor creatures out there be
helped? Must they drown?&#8221; whispered Helen
in Ruth&#8217;s ear.</p>

<p>Ruth did not believe that these men would give
up so easily. They were rough seamen; but the
helplessness of the castaways appealed to
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, boys!&#8221; commanded the captain of
the life saving crew. &#8220;Let&#8217;s git out the wagon.
I don&#8217;t suppose there&#8217;s any use, unless there comes
a lull in this etarnal gale. But we&#8217;ll try what
gunpowder will do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are they going to attempt now?&#8221;
Madge Steele asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;The beach wagon,&#8221; said somebody.
&#8220;They&#8217;ve gone for the gear.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was no explanation to the girls until Tom
Cameron came running back from the house and
announced that the crew were going to try to
reach the schooner with a line.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll try to save them with the breeches
buoy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They&#8217;ve got a life-car here;
but they never use that thing nowadays if they
can help. Too many castaways have been near
smothered in it, they say. If they can get a line
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>
over the wreck they&#8217;ll haul the crew in, one at
a time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that girl!&#8221; cried Ruth. &#8220;I hope they
will send her ashore first. How frightened she
must be.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no more rain falling now, although
the spray whipped from the crests of the waves
was flung across the beach and wet the sightseers.
But with the lightening of the clouds a pale
glow seemed to spread itself upon the tumultuous
sea.</p>

<p>The wreck could be seen almost as vividly as
when the signal lights were burned. The torn
clouds were driven across the heavens as rapidly
as the huge waves raced shoreward. And
behind both cloud and wave was the seething
gale. There seemed no prospect of the wind&#8217;s
falling.</p>

<p>Ruth turned to see the crew which had failed
to get the lifeboat to the wreck, trundling a
heavy, odd-looking, two-wheeled wagon down
upon the beach. They worked as though their
fight with the sea had been but the first round of
the battle. Their calmness and skillful handling
of the breeches buoy gear inspired the onlookers
with renewed hope.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Cap&#8217;n Abinadab and the boys will get
&#8217;em this time,&#8221; declared Heavy. &#8220;You just
watch.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>And Ruth Fielding and the others were not
likely to miss any motion of the crew of the life
saving station. The latter laid out the gear with
quick, sure action. The cannon was placed in
position and loaded. The iron bar to which the
line was attached was slipped into the muzzle
of the gun. The men stood back and the captain
pulled the lanyard.</p>

<p>Bang!</p>

<p>The sharp bark of the line-gun echoed distressingly
in their ears. It jumped back a pace,
for the captain had charged it to the full limit
allowed by the regulations. A heavier charge
might burst the gun.</p>

<p>The line-iron hurtled out over the sea in a
long, graceful curve, the line whizzing after it.
The line unwound so rapidly from the frame on
which it was coiled that Ruth&#8217;s gaze could not
follow it.</p>

<p>The sea was light enough for them to follow
the course of the iron, however, and a groan
broke from the lips of the onlookers when they
saw that the missile fell far short of the wreck.
To shoot the line into the very teeth of this gale,
as Cap&#8217;n Abinadab had said, was futile. Yet
he would not give up the attempt. This was
the only way that was now left for them to aid
the unfortunate crew of the lumber schooner.
If they could not get the breeches buoy to her
the sea would be the grave of the castaways.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>For already the waves, smashing down upon
the grounded wreck, were tearing it apart. She
would soon break in two, and then the remaining
rigging and spars would go by the board and
with them the crew and passengers.</p>

<p>Yet Captain Abinadab Cope refused to give
over his attempts to reach the wreck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Haul in!&#8221; he commanded gruffly, when the
line fell short. Ruth marveled at the skill of
the man who rewound the wet line on the pegs
of the frame that held it. In less than five minutes
the life-savers were ready for another shot.</p>

<p>&#8220;You take it when the regular crew are at
practice, sometimes,&#8221; whispered Heavy, to Ruth,
&#8220;and they work like lightning. They&#8217;ll shoot
the line and get a man ashore in the breeches
buoy in less than two minutes. But this is hard
work for these volunteers&#8211;and it means so
much!&#8221;</p>

<p>Ruth felt as though a hand clutched at her
heart. The unshed tears stung her eyes. If
they should fail&#8211;if all this effort should go for
naught! Suppose that unknown girl out there
on the wreck should be washed ashore in the
morning, pallid and dead.</p>

<p>The thought almost overwhelmed the girl
from the Red Mill. As the gun barked a second
time and the shot and line hurtled seaward, Ruth
Fielding&#8217;s pale lips uttered a whispered prayer.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>But</span> again the line fell short.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll never be able to make it,&#8221; Tom Cameron
said to the shivering girls.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I really wish we hadn&#8217;t come down
here,&#8221; murmured his sister.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, pshaw, Nell! don&#8217;t be a baby,&#8221; he
growled.</p>

<p>But he was either winking back the tears himself,
or the salt spray had gotten into his eyes.
How could anybody stand there on the beach and
feel unmoved when nine human beings, in view
now and then when the billows fell, were within
an ace of awful death?</p>

<p>Again and again the gun was shotted and the
captain pulled the lanyard. He tried to catch
the moment when there was a lull in the gale;
but each time the shot fell short. It seemed
to be merely a waste of human effort and gunpowder.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve &#8217;phoned to the Minot Cove station,&#8221; the
captain said, during one of the intervals while
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>
they were hauling in the line. &#8220;They&#8217;ve got a
power boat there, and if they can put to sea
with her they might get around to the other side
of the reef and take &#8217;em off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll go to pieces before a boat can come
from Minot Cove,&#8221; declared one grizzled fisherman.</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear so, Henry,&#8221; replied the captain.
&#8220;But we got to do what we can. They ain&#8217;t
give me no leeway with this gun. Orders is
never to give her a bigger charge than what she&#8217;s
gettin&#8217; now. But, I swan<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>He did not finish his sentence, but gravely
measured out the next charge of powder. When
he had loaded the gun he waved everybody back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Git clean away, you lads. All of ye, now!
She&#8217;ll probably blow up, but there ain&#8217;t no use
in more&#8217;n one of us blowin&#8217; up with her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What you done, Cap&#8217;n?&#8221; demanded one of
his crew.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never you mind, lad. Step back, I tell ye.
She&#8217;s slewed right now, I reckon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you got in her?&#8221; demanded the
man again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to reach them folk if I can,&#8221; returned
Cap&#8217;n Abinadab. &#8220;I&#8217;ve double charged
her. If she don&#8217;t carry the line this time, she
never will. And she may carry it over the wreck,
even if she blows up. Look out!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ye do it!&#8221; cried the man, Mason,
starting forward. &#8220;If you pull that lanyard
ye&#8217;ll be blowed sky-high.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, who should pull it if I don&#8217;t?&#8221; demanded
the old captain of the station, grimly.
&#8220;Guess old &#8217;Binadab Cope ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to step
back for you young fellers yet a while. Come!
git, I tell ye! Far back&#8211;afar back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! he&#8217;ll be killed!&#8221; murmured Ruth.</p>

<p>&#8220;You come back here, Ruth Fielding!&#8221; commanded
Tom, clutching her arm. &#8220;If that gun
blows up we want to be a good bit away.&#8221;</p>

<p>The whole party ran back. They saw the
last of the crew leave the old captain. He stood
firmly, at one side of the gun, his legs placed
wide apart; they saw him pull the lanyard. Fire
spat from the muzzle of the gun and with a
shriek the shot-line was carried seaward, toward
the wreck.</p>

<p>The old gun, double charged, turned a somersault
and buried its muzzle in the sand. The
captain dodged, and went down&#8211;perhaps
thrown by the force of the explosion. But the
gun did not burst.</p>

<p>However, he was upon his feet again in a
moment, and all the crowd were shouting their
congratulations. The flying line had carried
squarely over the middle of the wreck.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>&#8220;Now, will they know what to do with it?&#8221;
gasped Ruth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait! see that man&#8211;that man in the middle?
The line passed over his shoulder!&#8221; cried Heavy.
&#8220;See! he&#8217;s got it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And he&#8217;s hauling on it,&#8221; cried Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;There goes the line with the board attached,&#8221;
said Madge Steele, exultantly. The girls had already
examined this painted board. On it were
plain, though brief, instructions in English,
French, and Italian, to the wrecked crew as to
what they should do to aid in their own rescue.
But this schooner was probably from up Maine
way, or the &#8220;blue-nose country&#8221; of Nova Scotia,
and her crew would be familiar with the rigging
of the breeches buoy.</p>

<p>They saw, as another light was burned on the
wreck, the man who had seized the line creep
along to the single mast then standing. It was
broken short off fifteen feet above the deck. He
hauled out the shot-line, and then a mate came to
his assistance and they rigged the larger line that
followed and attached the block to the stump of
the mast.</p>

<p>Then on shore the crew of the life saving station
and the fishermen&#8211;even the boys from the
bungalow&#8211;hauled on the cable, and soon sent the
gear across the tossing waves. They had erected
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>
a stout pair of wooden &#8220;shears&#8221; in the sand and
over this the breeches buoy gear ran.</p>

<p>It went out empty, but the moment it reached
the staggering wreck the men there popped the
woman into the sack and those ashore hauled in.
Over and through the waves she came, and when
they caught her at the edge of the surf and
dragged the heavy buoy on to the dry land, she
was all but breathless, and was crying.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ye fear, Missus,&#8221; said one rough but
kindly boatman. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have yer little gal ashore
in a jiffy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8211;she isn&#8217;t my child, poor thing,&#8221; panted
the woman. &#8220;I&#8217;m Captain Kirby&#8217;s wife. Poor
Jim! he won&#8217;t leave till the last one<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course he won&#8217;t, ma&#8217;am&#8211;and you wouldn&#8217;t
want him to,&#8221; broke in Cap&#8217;n Cope. &#8220;A skipper&#8217;s
got to stand by his ship till his crew an&#8217;
passengers are safe. Now, you go right up to
the station<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, no!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;I must see them
all safe ashore.&#8221;</p>

<p>The huge buoy was already being hauled back
to the wreck. There was no time to be lost, for
the waves had torn away the after-deck and it
was feared the forward deck and the mast would
soon go.</p>

<p>Ruth went to the woman and spoke to her
softly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>&#8220;Who is the little girl, please?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;She ain&#8217;t little, Miss&#8211;no littler than you,&#8221;
returned Mrs. Kirby. &#8220;Her name is Nita.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nita?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what she calls herself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nita what?&#8221; asked Ruth.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m sure. I believe she&#8217;s run
away from her folks. She won&#8217;t tell much about
herself. She only came aboard at Portland. In
fact, I found her there on the dock, and she
seemed hungry and neglected, and she told us first
that she wanted to go to her folks in New York&#8211;and that&#8217;s where
the <i>Whipstitch</i> was bound.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The <i>Whipstitch</i> is the name of the schooner?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Miss. And now Jim&#8217;s lost her. But&#8211;thanks
be!&#8211;she was insured,&#8221; said the captain&#8217;s
wife.</p>

<p>At that moment another hearty shout went up
from the crowd on shore. The breeches buoy was
at the wreck again. They saw the men there lift
the girl into the buoy, which was rigged like a
great pair of overalls. The passenger sat in this
sack, with her legs thrust through the apertures
below, and clung to the ring of the buoy, which
was level with her shoulders.</p>

<p>She started from the ship in this rude conveyance,
and the girls gathered eagerly to greet her
when she landed. But several waves washed completely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span>
over the breeches buoy and the girl was
each time buried from sight. She was unconscious
when they lifted her out.</p>

<p>She was a black-haired girl of fourteen or thereabout,
well built and strong. The captain&#8217;s wife
was too anxious about the crew to pay much attention
to the waif, and Ruth and her friends bore
Nita, the castaway, off to the station, where it was
warm.</p>

<p>The boys remained to see the last of the crew&#8211;Captain
Kirby himself&#8211;brought ashore. And
none too soon was this accomplished, for within
the half hour the schooner had broken in two.
Its wreckage and the lumber with which it had
been loaded so covered the sea between the reef
and the shore that the waves were beaten down,
and had it been completely calm an active man
could have traveled dry-shod over the flotsam to
the reef.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Nita had been brought to her
senses. But there was nothing at the station for
the girl from the wreck to put on while her own
clothing was dried, and it was Heavy who came
forward with a very sensible suggestion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s take her home with us. Plenty of things
there. Wrap her up good and warm and we&#8217;ll
take her on the buckboard. We can all crowd
on&#8211;all but the boys.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys had not seen enough yet, anyway,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>
and were not ready to go; but the girls were eager
to return to the bungalow&#8211;especially when they
could take the castaway with them.</p>

<p>&#8220;And there we&#8217;ll get her to tell us all about
it,&#8221; whispered Helen to Ruth. &#8220;My! she must
have an interesting story to tell.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span><a id='link_11'></a>CHAPTER XI<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE STORY OF THE CASTAWAY</span></h2>

<p><span class='sc'>There</span> was only the cook in the station and
nobody to stop the girls from taking Nita away.
She had recovered her senses, but scarcely appreciated
as yet where she was; nor did she seem to
care what became of her.</p>

<p>Heavy called the man who had driven them
over, and in ten minutes after she was ashore the
castaway was on the buckboard with her new
friends and the ponies were bearing them all at a
spanking pace toward the Stone bungalow on
Lighthouse Point.</p>

<p>The fact that this strange girl had been no relation
of the wife of the schooner&#8217;s captain, and that
Mrs. Kirby seemed, indeed, to know very little
about her, mystified the stout girl and her friends
exceedingly. They whispered a good deal among
themselves about the castaway; but she sat between
Ruth and Helen and they said little to her
during the ride.</p>

<p>She had been wrapped in a thick blanket at the
station and was not likely to take cold; but Miss
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>
Kate and old Mammy Laura bustled about a good
deal when Nita was brought into the bungalow;
and very shortly she was tucked into one of the
beds on the second floor&#8211;in the very room in
which Ruth and Helen and Mercy were to sleep&#8211;and
Miss Kate had insisted upon her swallowing
a bowl of hot tea.</p>

<p>Nita seemed to be a very self-controlled girl.
She didn&#8217;t weep, now that the excitement was
past, as most girls would have done. But at
first she was very silent, and watched her entertainers
with snapping black eyes and&#8211;Ruth
thought&#8211;in rather a sly, sharp way. She seemed
to be studying each and every one of the girls&#8211;and
Miss Kate and Mammy Laura as well.</p>

<p>The boys came home after a time and announced
that every soul aboard the <i>Whipstitch</i>
was safe and sound in the life saving station.
And the captain&#8217;s wife had sent over word that
she and her husband would go back to Portland
the next afternoon. If the girl they had picked
up there on the dock wished to return, she must
be ready to go with them.</p>

<p>&#8220;What, go back to that town?&#8221; cried the castaway
when Ruth told her this, sitting right up
in bed. &#8220;Why, that&#8217;s the <i>last</i> place!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you don&#8217;t belong in Portland?&#8221; asked
Ruth.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should hope not!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>&#8220;Nor in Maine?&#8221; asked Madge, for the other
girls were grouped about the room. They were
all anxious to hear the castaway&#8217;s story.</p>

<p>The girl was silent for a moment, her lips very
tightly pressed together. Finally she said, with
her sly look:</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess I ain&#8217;t obliged to tell you that; am I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Witness does not wish to incriminate herself,&#8221;
snapped Mercy, her eyes dancing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know that I&#8217;m bound to tell you
girls everything I know,&#8221; said the strange girl,
coolly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right-oh!&#8221; cried Heavy, cordially. &#8220;You&#8217;re
visiting me. I don&#8217;t know as it is anybody&#8217;s business
how you came to go aboard the <i>Whipstitch</i><span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t mind telling you that,&#8221; said the
girl, eagerly. &#8220;I was hungry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hungry!&#8221; chorused her listeners, and Heavy
said: &#8220;Fancy being hungry, and having to go
aboard a ship to get a meal!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was it exactly,&#8221; said Nita, bluntly.
&#8220;But Mrs. Kirby was real good to me. And the
schooner was going to New York and that&#8217;s
where I wanted to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because your folks live there?&#8221; shot in The
Fox.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, they don&#8217;t, Miss Smartie!&#8221; snapped
back the castaway. &#8220;You don&#8217;t catch me so easy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>
I wasn&#8217;t born yesterday, Miss! My folks don&#8217;t
live in New York. Maybe I haven&#8217;t any folks.
I came from clear way out West, anyway&#8211;so
now! I thought &#8217;way down East must be the
finest place in the world. But it isn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you run away to come East?&#8221; asked
Ruth, quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&#8211;I came here, anyway. And I don&#8217;t
much like it, I can tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah-ha!&#8221; cried Mercy Curtis, chuckling to
herself. &#8220;I know. She thought Yankee Land
was just flowing in milk and honey. Listen!
here&#8217;s what she said to herself before she ran
away from home:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>&#8220;I wish I&#8217;d lived away Down East,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Where codfish salt the sea,</p>
<p>And where the folks have apple sass</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;And punkin pie fer tea!&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the &#8216;Western Girl's Lament,&#8217;&#8221; pursued
Mercy. &#8220;So you found &#8217;way down East nothing
like what you thought it was?&#8221;</p>

<p>The castaway scowled at the sharp-tongued
lame girl for a moment. Then she nodded.
&#8220;It&#8217;s the folks,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You&#8217;re all so afraid
of a stranger. Do I look like I&#8217;d <i>bite</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe not ordinarily,&#8221; said Helen, laughing
softly. &#8220;But you do not look very pleasant just
now.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>&#8220;Well, people haven&#8217;t been nice to me,&#8221; grumbled
the Western girl. &#8220;I thought there were
lots of rich men in the East, and that a girl could
make friends &#8217;most anywhere, and get into nice
families<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To <i>work?</i>&#8221; asked Ruth, curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no! You know, you read a lot about
rich folks taking up girls and doing everything
for them&#8211;dressing them fine, and sending them
to fancy schools, and all that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never read of any such thing in my life!&#8221;
declared Mary Cox. &#8220;I guess you&#8217;ve been reading
funny books.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; sniffed the castaway, who was evidently
a runaway and was not made sorry for her
escapade even by being wrecked at sea. &#8220;Huh!
I like a story with some life in it, I do! Jib
Pottoway had some dandy paper-covered novels
in his locker and he let me read &#8217;em<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who under the sun is Jib Pottoway?&#8221; gasped
Helen. &#8220;That isn&#8217;t a real name; is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s ugly enough to be real; isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; retorted
the strange girl, chuckling. &#8220;Yep. That&#8217;s
Jib&#8217;s real name. &#8216;Jibbeway Pottoway&#8217;&#8211;that&#8217;s
the whole of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, oh!&#8221; cried Heavy, with her hand to her
face. &#8220;It makes my jaw ache to even try to
say it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is he?&#8221; asked Madge, curiously.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span>&#8220;Injun,&#8221; returned the Western girl, laconically.
&#8220;Or, part Injun. He comes from &#8217;way up
Canada way. His folks had Jibbeway blood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But <i>who</i> is he?&#8221; queried Ruth, curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, he&#8217;s a puncher that works for<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>Well,
he&#8217;s a cow puncher. That&#8217;s &#8217;nuff. It don&#8217;t
matter where he works,&#8221; added the girl, gruffly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That might give away where you come from,
eh?&#8221; put in Mercy.</p>

<p>&#8220;It might,&#8221; and Nita laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what is your name?&#8221; asked Ruth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nita, I tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nita what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind. Just Nita. Mebbe I never had
another name. Isn&#8217;t one name at a time sufficient,
Miss?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe that is your really-truly
name,&#8221; said Ruth, gravely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I bet you&#8217;re right, Ruth Fielding!&#8221; cried
Heavy, chuckling. &#8220;&#8216;Nita&#8217; and &#8216;Jib Pottoway&#8217;
don&#8217;t seem to go together. &#8216;Nita&#8217; is altogether
too fancy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a nice name!&#8221; exclaimed the strange girl,
in some anger. &#8220;It was the name of the girl in
the paper-covered novel&#8211;and it&#8217;s good enough
for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what&#8217;s your real name?&#8221; urged Ruth.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not telling you that,&#8221; replied the runaway,
shortly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>&#8220;Then you prefer to go under a false name&#8211;even
among your friends?&#8221; asked the girl from
the Red Mill.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do I know you&#8217;re my friends?&#8221; demanded
Nita, promptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t very well be your enemies,&#8221; said
Helen, in some disgust.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Anybody&#8217;s my enemy who
wants to send me back&#8211;well, anyone who wants
to return me to the place I came from.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was it an institution?&#8221; asked Mary Cox
quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; demanded Nita, puzzled.
&#8220;What do you mean by an &#8216;institution&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She means a sort of school,&#8221; explained
Ruth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221; exclaimed The Fox, sharply. &#8220;A reform
school, or something of the kind. Maybe
an almshouse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never heard of &#8217;em,&#8221; returned Nita, unruffled
by the insinuation. &#8220;Guess they don&#8217;t have
&#8217;em where I come from. Did <i>you</i> go to one,
Miss?&#8221;</p>

<p>Heavy giggled, and Madge Steele rapped The
Fox smartly on the shoulder. &#8220;There!&#8221; said
the senior. &#8220;It serves you right, Mary Cox.
You&#8217;re answered.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, I tell you what it is!&#8221; cried the strange
girl, sitting up in bed again and looking rather
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>
flushed, &#8220;if you girls are going to nag me, and
bother me about who I am, and where I come
from, and what my name is&#8211;though Nita&#8217;s a
good enough name for anybody<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anybody but Jib Pottoway,&#8221; chuckled Heavy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well! and <i>he</i> warn&#8217;t so bad, if he <i>was</i> half
Injun,&#8221; snapped the runaway. &#8220;Well, anyway,
if you don&#8217;t leave me alone I&#8217;ll get out of bed
right now and walk out of here. I guess you
haven&#8217;t any hold on me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Better wait till your clothes are dry,&#8221; suggested
Madge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aunt Kate would never let you go,&#8221; said
Heavy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go to-morrow morning, then!&#8221; cried the
runaway.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, we don&#8217;t mean to nag you,&#8221; interposed
Ruth, soothingly. &#8220;But of course we&#8217;re curious&#8211;and interested.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re like all the other Eastern folk I&#8217;ve
met,&#8221; declared Nita. &#8220;And I don&#8217;t like you
much. I thought <i>you</i> were different.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been expecting some rich man to
adopt you, and dress you in lovely clothes, and
all that, eh?&#8221; said Mercy Curtis.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well! I guess there are not so many millionaires
in the East as they said there was,&#8221; grumbled
Nita.</p>

<p>&#8220;Or else they&#8217;ve already got girls of their own
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>
to look after,&#8221; laughed Ruth. &#8220;Why, Helen
here, has a father who is very rich. But you
couldn&#8217;t expect him to give up Helen and Tom
and take you into his home instead, could you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nita glanced at the dry-goods merchant&#8217;s
daughter with more interest for a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;And Heavy&#8217;s father is awfully rich, too,&#8221;
said Ruth. &#8220;But he&#8217;s got Heavy to support<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;s some job,&#8221; broke in Madge,
laughing. &#8220;Two such daughters as Heavy would
make poor dear Papa Stone a pauper!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Nita, again, &#8220;I&#8217;ve talked enough.
I won&#8217;t tell you where I come from. And Nita <i>is</i>
my name&#8211;now!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is getting late,&#8221; said Ruth, mildly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
you all think it would be a good plan to go to bed?
The wind&#8217;s gone down some. I guess we can
sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good advice,&#8221; agreed Madge Steele. &#8220;The
boys have been abed some time. To-morrow is
another day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Heavy and she and Mary went off to their
room. The others made ready for bed, and the
runaway did not say another word to them, but
turned her face to the wall and appeared, at least,
to be soon asleep.</p>

<p>Ruth crept in beside her so as not to disturb
their strange guest. She was a new type of girl
to Ruth&#8211;and to the others. Her independence
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>
of speech, her rough and ready ways, and her
evident lack of the influence of companionship
with refined girls were marked in this Nita&#8217;s character.</p>

<p>Ruth wondered much what manner of home
she could have come from, why she had run away
from it, and what Nita really proposed doing so
far from home and friends. These queries kept
the girl from the Red Mill awake for a long
time&#8211;added to which was the excitement of the
evening, which was not calculated to induce sleep.</p>

<p>She would have dropped off some time after the
other girls, however, had she not suddenly heard
a door latch somewhere on this upper floor, and
then the creep, creep, creeping of a rustling step
in the hall. It continued so long that Ruth wondered
if one of the girls in the other room was
ill, and she softly arose and went to the door,
which was ajar. And what she saw there in the
hall startled her.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span><a id='link_12'></a>CHAPTER XII<br /><span class='h2fs'>BUSY IZZY IN A NEW ASPECT</span></h2>

<p><span class='sc'>The</span> stair-well was a wide and long opening
and around it ran a broad balustrade. There
was no stairway to the third floor of this big
bungalow, only the servants&#8217; staircase in the rear
reaching those rooms directly under the roof. So
the hall on this second floor, out of which the
family bedrooms opened, was an L-shaped room,
with the balustrade on one hand.</p>

<p>And upon that balustrade Ruth Fielding beheld
a tottering figure in white, plainly visible in the
soft glow of the single light burning below, yet
rather ghostly after all.</p>

<p>She might have been startled in good earnest
had she not first of all recognized Isadore Phelps&#8217;
face. He was balancing himself upon the balustrade
and, as she came to the door, he walked
gingerly along the narrow strip of moulding toward
Ruth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Izzy! whatever are you doing?&#8221; she hissed.</p>

<p>The boy never said a word to her, but kept
right on, balancing himself with difficulty. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>
was in his pajamas, his feet bare, and&#8211;she saw
it at last&#8211;his eyes tight shut.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! he&#8217;s asleep,&#8221; murmured Ruth.</p>

<p>And that surely was Busy Izzy&#8217;s state at that
moment. Sound asleep and &#8220;tight-rope walking&#8221;
on the balustrade.</p>

<p>Ruth knew that it would be dangerous to
awaken him suddenly&#8211;especially as it might
cause him to fall down the stair-well. She crept
back into her room and called Helen. The two
girls in their wrappers and slippers went into the
hall again. There was Busy Izzy tottering along
in the other direction, having turned at the wall.
Once they thought he would plunge down the
stairway, and Helen grabbed at Ruth with a
squeal of terror.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sh!&#8221; whispered her chum. &#8220;Go tell Tom.
Wake him up. The boys ought to tie Izzy in
bed if he is in the habit of doing this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My! isn&#8217;t he a sight!&#8221; giggled Helen, as she
ran past the gyrating youngster, who had again
turned for a third perambulation of the railing.</p>

<p>She whispered Tom&#8217;s name at his open door
and in a minute the girls heard him bound out of
bed. He was with them&#8211;sleepy-eyed and hastily
wrapping his robe about him&#8211;in a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;For the land&#8217;s sake!&#8221; he gasped, when he
saw his friend on the balustrade. &#8220;What are
you<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>&#8220;Sh!&#8221; commanded Ruth. &#8220;He&#8217;s asleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom took in the situation at a glance. Madge
Steele peered out of her door at that moment.
&#8220;Who is it&#8211;Bobbins?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. It&#8217;s Izzy. He&#8217;s walking in his sleep,&#8221;
said Ruth.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a regular somnambulist,&#8221; exclaimed
Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind. Don&#8217;t call him names. He
can&#8217;t help it,&#8221; said Madge.</p>

<p>Helen giggled again. Tom had darted back
to rouse his chum. Bob Steele appeared, more
tousled and more sleepy-looking than Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with that fellow now?&#8221;
he grumbled. &#8220;He&#8217;s like a flea&#8211;you never
know where he&#8217;s going to be next! Ha! he&#8217;ll
fall off that and break his silly neck.&#8221;</p>

<p>And as Busy Izzy was just then nearest his end
of the hall in his strange gyrations, Bob Steele
stepped forward and grabbed him, lifting him
bodily off the balustrade. Busy Izzy screeched,
but Tom clapped a hand over his mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shut up! want to raise the whole neighborhood?&#8221;
grunted Bobbins, dragging the lightly attired,
struggling boy back into their room. &#8220;Ha!
I&#8217;ll fix you after this. I&#8217;ll lash you to the bedpost
every night we&#8217;re here&#8211;now mark that,
young man!&#8221;</p>

<p>It seemed that the youngster often walked in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>
his sleep, but the girls had not known it. Usually,
at school, his roommates kept the dormitory door
locked and the key hidden, so that he couldn&#8217;t get
out to do himself any damage running around
with his eyes shut.</p>

<p>The party all got to sleep again after that and
there was no further disturbance before morning.
They made a good deal of fun of Isadore
at the breakfast table, but he took the joking
philosophically. He was always playing pranks
himself; but he had learned to take a joke, too.</p>

<p>He declared that all he dreamed during the
night was that he was wrecked in an iceboat on
Second Reef and that the only way for him to
get ashore was to walk on a cable stretched from
the wreck to the beach. He had probably been
walking that cable&#8211;in his mind&#8211;when Ruth had
caught him balancing on the balustrade.</p>

<p>The strange girl who persisted in calling herself
&#8220;Nita&#8221; came down to the table in some of
Heavy&#8217;s garments, which were a world too large
for her. Her own had been so shrunk and stained
by the sea-water that they would never be fit to
put on again. Aunt Kate was very kind to her,
but she looked at the runaway oddly, too. Nita
had been just as uncommunicative to her as she
had been to the girls in the bedroom the night
before.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t like me, or don&#8217;t like my name,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>
I can go away,&#8221; she declared to Miss Kate, coolly.
&#8220;I haven&#8217;t got to stay here, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But where will you go? what will you do?&#8221;
demanded that young lady, severely. &#8220;You say
the captain of the schooner and his wife are nothing
to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say not!&#8221; exclaimed Nita. &#8220;They
were nice and kind to me, though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you can&#8217;t go away until you have something
decent to wear,&#8221; added Heavy&#8217;s aunt.
&#8220;That&#8217;s the first thing to &#8217;tend to.&#8221;</p>

<p>And although it was a bright and beautiful
morning after the gale, and there were a dozen
things the girls were all eager to see, they spent
the forenoon in trying to make up an outfit for
Nita so that she would be presentable. The boys
went off with Mr. Stone&#8217;s boatkeeper in the motor
launch and Mary Cox was quite cross because the
other girls would not leave Miss Kate to fix up
Nita the best she could, so that they could all
accompany the boys. But in the afternoon the
buckboard was brought around and they drove to
the lighthouse.</p>

<p>Nita, even in her nondescript garments, was
really a pretty girl. No awkwardness of apparel
could hide the fact that she had nice features and
that her body was strong and lithe. She moved
about with a freedom that the other girls did not
possess. Even Ruth was not so athletic as the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span>
strange girl. And yet she seemed to know nothing
at all about the games and the exercises which
were commonplace to the girls from Briarwood
Hall.</p>

<p>There was a patch of wind-blown, stunted trees
and bushes covering several acres of the narrowing
point, before the driving road along the ridge
brought the visitors to Sokennet Light. While
they were driving through this a man suddenly
bobbed up beside the way and the driver hailed
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo, you Crab!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Found anything
&#8217;long shore from that wreck?&#8221;</p>

<p>The man stood up straight and the girls
thought him a very horrid-looking object. He
had a great beard and his hair was dark and
long.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a bad one for looks; ain&#8217;t he, Miss?&#8221;
asked the driver of Ruth, who sat beside him.</p>

<p>&#8220;He isn&#8217;t very attractive,&#8221; she returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha! I guess not. And Crab&#8217;s as bad as he
looks, which is saying a good deal. He comes of
the &#8216;wreckers.&#8217; Before there was a light here,
or life saving stations along this coast, there was
folks lived along here that made their livin&#8217; out
of poor sailors wrecked out there on the reefs.
Some said they used to toll vessels onto the rocks
with false lights. Anyhow, Crab&#8217;s father, and his
gran&#8217;ther, was wreckers. He&#8217;s assistant lightkeeper;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>
but he oughtn&#8217;t to be. I don&#8217;t see how
Mother Purling can get along with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She isn&#8217;t afraid of him; is she?&#8221; queried
Ruth.</p>

<p>&#8220;She isn&#8217;t afraid of anything,&#8221; said Heavy,
quickly, from the rear seat. &#8220;You wait till you
see her.&#8221;</p>

<p>The buckboard went heavily on toward the
lighthouse; but the girls saw that the man stood
for a long time&#8211;as long as they were in sight,
at least&#8211;staring after them.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you suppose he looked at Nita so
hard for?&#8221; whispered Helen in Ruth&#8217;s ear. &#8220;I
thought he was going to speak to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Ruth had not noticed this, nor did the runaway
girl seem to have given the man any particular
attention.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span><a id='link_13'></a>CHAPTER XIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>CRAB PROVES TO BE OF THE HARDSHELL VARIETY</span></h2>

<p><span class='sc'>They</span> came to the lighthouse. There was only
a tiny, whitewashed cottage at the foot of the tall
shaft. It seemed a long way to the brass-trimmed
and glistening lantern at the top. Ruth wondered
how the gaunt old woman who came to the door
to welcome them could ever climb those many,
many stairs to the narrow gallery at the top of
the shaft. She certainly could not suffer as Aunt
Alvirah did with <i>her</i> back and bones.</p>

<p>Sokennet Light was just a steady, bright light,
sending its gleam far seaward. There was no
mechanism for turning, such as marks the revolving
lights in so many lighthouses. The simplicity
of everything about Sokennet Light was what
probably led the department officials to allow
Mother Purling to remain after her husband
died in harness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jack Crab has done his cleaning and gone
about his business,&#8221; said Mother Purling, to the
girls. &#8220;Ye may all climb up to the lantern if ye
wish; but touch nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Beside the shaft of the light was a huge fog
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>
bell. That was rung by clockwork. Mother
Purling showed Ruth and her companions how it
worked before the girls started up the stairs.
Mercy remained in the little house with the good
old woman, for she never could have hobbled up
those spiral stairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too bad about that girl,&#8221; said Nita,
brusquely, to Ruth. &#8220;Has she always been
lame?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ruth warmed toward the runaway immediately
when she found that Nita was touched by Mercy
Curtis&#8217; affliction. She told Nita how the lame
girl had once been much worse off than she was
now, and all about her being operated on by the
great physician.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s so much better off now than she was!&#8221;
cried Ruth. &#8220;And so much happier!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But she&#8217;s a great nuisance to have along,&#8221;
snapped Mary Cox, immediately behind them.
&#8220;She had better stayed at home, I should
think.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ruth flushed angrily, but before she could
speak, Nita said, looking coolly at The Fox:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a might snappy, snarly sort of a girl;
ain&#8217;t you? And you think you are dreadfully
smart. But somebody told you that. It ain&#8217;t so.
I&#8217;ve seen a whole lot smarter than you. You
wouldn&#8217;t last long among the boys where <i>I</i> come
from.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>&#8220;Thank you!&#8221; replied Mary, her head in the
air. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t care to be liked by the boys.
It isn&#8217;t ladylike to think of the boys all the
time<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;These are grown men, I mean,&#8221; said Nita,
coolly. &#8220;The punchers that work for&#8211;well, just
cow punchers. You call them cowboys. They
know what&#8217;s good and fine, jest as well as Eastern
folks. And a girl that talks like you do about a
cripple wouldn&#8217;t go far with them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose your friend, the half-Indian, is a
critic of deportment,&#8221; said The Fox, with a laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Jib wouldn&#8217;t say anything mean about
a cripple,&#8221; said Nita, in her slow way, and The
Fox seemed to have no reply.</p>

<p>But this little by-play drew Ruth Fielding closer
to the queer girl who had selected her &#8220;hifaluting&#8221;
name because it was the name of a girl in
a paper-covered novel.</p>

<p>Nita had lived out of doors, that was plain.
Ruth believed, from what the runaway had said,
that she came from the plains of the great West.
She had lived on a ranch. Perhaps her folks
owned a ranch, and they might even now be
searching the land over for their daughter. The
thought made the girl from the Red Mill very
serious, and she determined to try and gain Nita&#8217;s
confidence and influence her, if she could, to tell
the truth about herself and to go back to her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>
home. She knew that she could get Mr. Cameron
to advance Nita&#8217;s fare to the West, if the girl
would return.</p>

<p>But up on the gallery in front of the shining
lantern of the lighthouse there was no chance to
talk seriously to the runaway. Heavy had to sit
down when she reached this place, and she declared
that she puffed like a steam engine. Then,
when she had recovered her breath, she pointed
out the places of interest to be seen from the
tower&#8211;the smoke of Westhampton to the north;
Fuller&#8217;s Island, with its white sands and gleaming
green lawns and clumps of wind-blown trees; the
long strip of winding coast southward, like a ribbon
laid down for the sea to wash, and far, far
to the east, over the tumbling waves, still boisterous
with the swell of last night&#8217;s storm, the
white riding sail of the lightship on No Man&#8217;s
Shoal.</p>

<p>They came down after an hour, wind-blown,
the taste of salt on their lips, and delighted with
the view. They found the ugly, hairy man sitting
on the doorstep, listening with a scowl and a grin
to Mercy&#8217;s sharp speeches.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what brought you back here to
the light, Jack Crab, at this time of day,&#8221; said
Mother Purling. &#8220;You ain&#8217;t wanted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I likes to see comp&#8217;ny, too, <i>I</i> do,&#8221; growled
the man.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>&#8220;Well, these girls ain&#8217;t your company,&#8221; returned
the old woman. &#8220;Now! get up and be
off. Get out of the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Crab rose, surlily enough, but his sharp eyes
sought Nita. He looked her all over, as though
she were some strange object that he had never
seen before.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you air the gal they brought ashore off
the lumber schooner last night?&#8221; he asked
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I am,&#8221; she returned, flatly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t got no folks around here; hev ye?&#8221;
he continued.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I haven&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Puddin&#8217; Tame!&#8221; retorted Mercy, breaking
in, in her shrill way. &#8220;And she lives in the lane,
and her number&#8217;s cucumber! There now! do
you know all you want to know, Hardshell?&#8221;</p>

<p>Crab growled something under his breath and
went off in a hangdog way.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a bad man,&#8221; said Mercy, with confidence.
&#8220;And he&#8217;s much interested in you, Miss
Nita Anonymous. Do you know why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t,&#8221; replied Nita, laughing quite
as sharply as before, but helping the lame girl to
the buckboard with kindliness.</p>

<p>&#8220;You look out for him, then,&#8221; said Mercy,
warningly. &#8220;He&#8217;s a hardshell crab, all right.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>
And either he thinks he knows you, or he&#8217;s got
something in his mind that don&#8217;t mean good to
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>But only Ruth heard this. The others were
bidding Mother Purling good-bye.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span><a id='link_14'></a>CHAPTER XIV<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE TRAGIC INCIDENT IN A FISHING EXCURSION</span></h2>

<p><span class='sc'>The</span> boys had returned when the party drove
back to the bungalow from the lighthouse. A
lighthouse might be interesting, and it was fine
to see twenty-odd miles to the No Man&#8217;s Shoal,
and Mother Purling might be a <i>dear</i>&#8211;but the
girls hadn&#8217;t done anything, and the boys had.
They had fished for halibut and had caught a
sixty-five-pound one. Bobbins had got it on his
hook; but it took all three of them, with the boatkeeper&#8217;s
advice, to get the big, flapping fish over
the side.</p>

<p>They had part of that fish for supper. Heavy
was enraptured, and the other girls had a saltwater
appetite that made them enjoy the fish, too.
It was decided to try for blackfish off the rocks
beyond Sokennet the next morning.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll go over in the <i>Miraflame</i>&#8221;&#8211;(that was
the name of the motor boat)&#8211;&#8220;and we&#8217;ll take
somebody with us to help Phineas,&#8221; Heavy declared.
Phineas was the boatman who had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>
charge of Mr. Stone&#8217;s little fleet. &#8220;Phin is a
great cook and he&#8217;ll get us up a regular fish
dinner<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear, Jennie Stone! how <i>can</i> you?&#8221;
broke in Helen, with her hands clasped.</p>

<p>&#8220;How can I <i>what</i>, Miss?&#8221; demanded the stout
girl, scenting trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;How can you, when we are eating such a perfect
dinner as this, be contemplating any other
future occasion when we possibly shall be hungry?&#8221;</p>

<p>The others laughed, but Heavy looked at her
school friends with growing contempt. &#8220;You
talk&#8211;you talk,&#8221; she stammered, &#8220;well! you don&#8217;t
talk English&#8211;that I&#8217;m sure of! And you needn&#8217;t
put it all on me. You all eat with good appetites.
And you&#8217;d better thank me, not quarrel with me.
If I didn&#8217;t think of getting nice things to eat,
you&#8217;d miss a lot, now I tell you. You don&#8217;t know
how I went out in Mammy Laura&#8217;s kitchen this
very morning, before most of you had your hair
out of curl-papers, and just <i>slaved</i> to plan the
meals for to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hear! hear!&#8221; chorused the boys, drumming
with their knife handles on the table. &#8220;We&#8217;re
for Jennie! She&#8217;s all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;See!&#8221; flashed in Mercy, with a gesture.
&#8220;Miss Stone has won the masculine portion of
the community by the only unerring way&#8211;the only
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>
straight path to the heart of a boy is through his
stomach.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess we can all thank Jennie,&#8221; said Ruth,
laughing quietly, &#8220;for her attention to our appetites.
But I fear if she had expected to fast herself
to-day she&#8217;d still be abed!&#8221;</p>

<p>They were all lively at dinner, and they spent
a lively evening, towards the end of which Bob
Steele gravely went out of doors and brought in
an old boat anchor, or kedge, weighing so many
pounds that even he could scarcely carry it upstairs
to the bed chamber which he shared with
Tom and Isadore.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do with that thing,
Bobby Steele?&#8221; demanded his sister.</p>

<p>&#8220;Going to anchor Busy Izzy to it with a rope.
I bet he won&#8217;t walk far in his sleep to-night,&#8221;
declared Bobbins.</p>

<p>With the fishing trip in their minds, all were
astir early the next morning. Miss Kate had
agreed to go with them, for Mercy believed that
she could stand the trip, as the sea was again calm.
She could remain in the cabin of the motor boat
while the others were fishing off the rocks for
tautog and rock-bass. The boys all had poles; but
the girls said they would be content to cast their
lines from the rock and hope for nibbles from the
elusive blackfish.</p>

<p>The <i>Miraflame</i> was a roomy craft and well
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>
furnished. When they started at nine o&#8217;clock the
party numbered eleven, besides the boatman and
his assistant. To the surprise of Ruth&#8211;and it
was remarked in whispers by the other girls, too&#8211;Phineas, the
boatkeeper, had chosen Jack Crab
to assist him in the management of the motor
boat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jack doesn&#8217;t have to be at the light till dark.
The old lady gets along all right alone,&#8221; explained
Phineas. &#8220;And it ain&#8217;t many of these longshoremen
who know how to handle a motor. Jack&#8217;s
used to machinery.&#8221;</p>

<p>He seemed to feel that it was necessary to
excuse himself for hiring the hairy man. But
Heavy only said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, as long as he behaves himself I don&#8217;t
care. But I didn&#8217;t suppose you liked the fellow,
Phin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t. It was Hobson&#8217;s choice, Miss,&#8221; returned
the sailor.</p>

<p>Phineas, the girls found, was a very pleasant
and entertaining man. And he knew all about
fishing. He had supplied the bait for tautog, and
the girls and boys of the party, all having lived
inland, learned many things that they hadn&#8217;t
known before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at this!&#8221; cried Madge Steele, the first
to discover a miracle. &#8220;He says this bait for
tautog is scallops! Now, that quivering, jelly-like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>
body is never a scallop. Why, a scallop is a firm,
white lump<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a mussel,&#8221; said Heavy, laughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only the &#8216;eye&#8217; of the scallop you eat,
Miss,&#8221; explained Phineas.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I know just as much as I did before,&#8221;
declared Madge. &#8220;So I eat a scallop&#8217;s <i>eye</i>, do
I? We had them for breakfast this very morning&#8211;with
bacon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you did, Miss. I raked &#8217;em up myself yesterday
afternoon,&#8221; explained Phineas. &#8220;You eat
the &#8216;eye,&#8217; but these are the bodies, and they are
the reg&#8217;lar natural food of the tautog, or blackfish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The edible part of the scallop is that muscle
which adheres to the shell&#8211;just like the muscle
that holds the clam to its shell,&#8221; said Heavy, who,
having spent several summers at the shore, was
better informed than her friends.</p>

<p>Phineas showed the girls how to bait their
hooks with the soft bodies of the scallop, warning
them to cover the point of the hooks well, and to
pull quickly if they felt the least nibble.</p>

<p>&#8220;The tautog is a small-mouthed fish&#8211;smaller,
even, than the bass the boys are going to cast for.
So, when he touches the hook at all, you want to
grab him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does it <i>hurt</i> the fish to be caught?&#8221; asked
Helen, curiously.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>Phineas grinned. &#8220;I never axed &#8217;em, ma&#8217;am,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>The <i>Miraflame</i> carried them swiftly down the
cove, or harbor, of Sokennet and out past the
light. The sea was comparatively calm, but the
surf roared against the rocks which hedged in the
sand dunes north of the harbor&#8217;s mouth. It was
in this direction that Phineas steered the launch,
and for ten miles the craft spun along at a pace
that delighted the whole party.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re just skimming the water!&#8221; cried Tom
Cameron. &#8220;Oh, Nell! I&#8217;m going to coax father
till he buys one for us to use on the Lumano.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll help tease,&#8221; agreed his twin, her eyes
sparkling.</p>

<p>Nita, the runaway, looked from brother to sister
with sudden interest. &#8220;Does your father give
you everything you ask him for?&#8221; she demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much!&#8221; cried Tom. &#8220;But dear old dad
is pretty easy with us and&#8211;Mrs. Murchiston says&#8211;gives in to
us too much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, does he buy you such things as boats&#8211;right
out&#8211;for you just to play with?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, of course!&#8221; cried Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I couldn&#8217;t even have a piano,&#8221; muttered
Nita, turning away with a shrug. &#8220;I told him he
was a mean old hunks!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whom did you say that to?&#8221; asked Ruth,
quietly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>&#8220;Never you mind!&#8221; returned Nita, angrily.
&#8220;But that&#8217;s what he is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ruth treasured these observations of the runaway.
She was piecing them together, and although
as yet it was a very patched bit of work,
she was slowly getting a better idea of who Nita
was and her home surroundings.</p>

<p>Finally the <i>Miraflame</i> ran in between a sheltering
arm of rock and the mainland. The sea was
very still in here, the heave and surge of the water
only murmuring among the rocks. There was an
old fishing dock at which the motor boat was
moored. Then everybody went ashore and Phineas
and Jack Crab pointed out the best fishing
places along the rocks.</p>

<p>These were very rugged ledges, and the water
sucked in among them, and hissed, and chuckled,
and made all sorts of gurgling sounds while the
tide rose. There were small caves and little
coves and all manner of odd hiding places in the
rocks.</p>

<p>But the girls and boys were too much interested
in the proposed fishing to bother about anything
else just then. Phineas placed Ruth on the side
of a round-topped boulder, where she stood on
a very narrow ledge, with a deep green pool at
her feet. She was hidden from the other fishers&#8211;even
from the boys, who clambered around to the
tiny cape that sheltered the basin into which the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>
motor boat had been run, and from the point of
which they expected to cast for bass.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Miss,&#8221; said the boatkeeper, &#8220;down at
the bottom of this still pool Mr. Tautog is feeding
on the rocks. Drop your baited hook down
gently to him. And if he nibbles, pull sharply at
first, and then, with a stead, hand-over-hand motion,
draw him in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ruth was quite excited; but once she saw Nita
and the man, Crab, walking farther along the
rocks, and Ruth wondered that the fellow was so
attentive to the runaway. But this was merely a
passing thought. Her mind returned to the line
she watched.</p>

<p>She pulled it up after a long while; the hook
was bare. Either Mr. Tautog had been very,
very careful when he nibbled the bait, or the said
bait had slipped off. It was not easy to make the
jelly-like body of the scallop remain on the hook.
But Ruth was as anxious to catch a fish as the
other girls, and she had watched Phineas with
sharp and eager eyes when he baited the
hook.</p>

<p>Ruth dropped it over the edge of the rock again
after a minute. It sank down, down, down<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>Was
that a nibble? She felt the faintest sort of
a jerk on the line. Surely something was at the
bait!</p>

<p>Again the jerk. Ruth returned the compliment
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>
by giving the line a prompt tug. Instantly she
knew that she had hooked him!</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! <i>oh!</i> <span class='sc'>oh</span>!&#8221; she gasped, in a rising scale
of delight and excitement.</p>

<p>She pulled in on the line. The fish was heavy,
and he tried to pull his way, too. The blackfish
is not much of a fighter, but he can sag back and
do his obstinate best to remain in the water when
the fisher is determined to get him out.</p>

<p>This fellow weighed two pounds and a half
and was well hooked. Ruth, her cheeks glowing,
her eyes dancing, hauled in, and in, and in<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>There
he came out of the water, a plump, glistening
body, that flapped and floundered in the air,
and on the ledge at her feet. She desired mightily
to cry out; but Phineas had warned them all to
be still while they fished. Their voices might
scare all the fish away.</p>

<p>She unhooked it beautifully, seizing it firmly
in the gills. Phineas had shown her where to lay
any she might catch in a little cradle in the rock
behind her. It was a damp little hollow, and
Mr. Tautog could not flop out into the sea again.</p>

<p>Oh! it was fun to bait the hook once more with
trembling fingers, and heave the weighted line
over the edge of the narrow ledge on which she
stood. There might be another&#8211;perhaps even
a bigger one&#8211;waiting down there to seize upon
the bait.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>And just then Mary Cox, her hair tousled and
a distressfully discontented expression on her face,
came around the corner of the big boulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Hullo!&#8221; she said, discourteously.
&#8220;You here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sh!&#8221; whispered Ruth, intent on the line and
the pool of green water.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you?&#8221; snapped The
Fox. &#8220;Don&#8217;t say you&#8217;ve got a bite! I&#8217;m sick of
hearing them say it over there<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve caught one,&#8221; said Ruth, with pride, pointing
to the glistening tautog lying on the rock.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Of course, &#8217;twould be you who got it,&#8221;
snarled Mary. &#8220;I bet he gave you the best
place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Please</i> keep still!&#8221; begged Ruth. &#8220;I believe
I&#8217;ve got another bite.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have a dozen for all I care,&#8221; returned Mary.
&#8220;I want to get past you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait! I feel a nibble<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>But Mary pushed rudely by. She took the inside
of the path, of course. The ledge was very
narrow, and Ruth was stooping over the deep
pool, breathlessly watching the line.</p>

<p>With a half-stifled scream Ruth fell forward,
flinging out both hands. Mary clutched at her&#8211;she
<i>did</i> try to save her. But she was not quick
enough. Ruth dropped like a plummet and the
green water closed over her with scarcely a splash.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>Mary did not cry out. She was speechless with
fear, and stood with clasped hands, motionless,
upon the path.</p>

<p>&#8220;She can swim! she can swim!&#8221; was the
thought that shuttled back and forth in The Fox&#8217;s
brain.</p>

<p>But moment after moment passed and Ruth did
not come to the surface. The pool was as calm
as before, save for the vanishing rings that broke
against the surrounding rocks. Mary held her
breath. She began to feel as though it were a
dream, and that her school companion had not
really fallen into the pool. It must be an hallucination,
for Ruth did not come to the surface
again!</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span><a id='link_15'></a>CHAPTER XV<br /><span class='h2fs'>TOM CAMERON TO THE RESCUE</span></h2>

<p><span class='sc'>The</span> three boys were on the other side of the
narrow inlet where the <i>Miraflame</i> lay. Phineas
had told them that bass were more likely to be
found upon the ocean side; therefore they were
completely out of sight.</p>

<p>The last Tom, Bob and Isadora saw of the
girls, the fishermen were placing them along the
rocky path, and Mercy was lying in a deck chair
on the deck of the launch, fluttering a handkerchief
at them as they went around the end of the
reef.</p>

<p>&#8220;I bet they don&#8217;t get a fish,&#8221; giggled Isadore.
&#8220;And even Miss Kate&#8217;s got a line! What do
girls know about fishing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If there&#8217;s any tautog over there, I bet Helen
and Ruth get &#8217;em. They&#8217;re all right in any game,&#8221;
declared the loyal Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Madge will squeal and want somebody to
take the fish off her hook, if she does catch one,&#8221;
grinned Bob. &#8220;She puts on lots of airs because
she&#8217;s the oldest; but she&#8217;s a regular &#8216;scare-cat,&#8217;
after all.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>&#8220;Helen and Ruth are good fellows,&#8221; returned
Tom, with emphasis. &#8220;They&#8217;re quite as good fun
as the ordinary boy&#8211;of course, not you, Bobbins,
or Busy Izzy here; but they are all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think of that Nita girl?&#8221; asked
Busy Izzy, suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe there&#8217;s something to her,&#8221; declared
Bob, with conviction. &#8220;She ain&#8217;t afraid of a living
thing, I bet!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is something queer about her,&#8221; Tom
added, thoughtfully. &#8220;Have you noticed how
that Crab fellow looks at her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see he hangs about her a good bit,&#8221; said
Isadore, quickly. &#8220;Why, do you suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I&#8217;d like to know,&#8221; returned Tom
Cameron.</p>

<p>They were now where Phineas had told them
bass might be caught, and gave their attention to
their tackle. All three boys had fished for perch,
pike, and other gamey fresh-water fish; but this
was their first casting with a rod into salt water.</p>

<p>&#8220;A true disciple of Izaak Walton should be
dumb,&#8221; declared Tom, warningly eyeing Isadore.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t he allowed any leeway at all&#8211;not even
when he lands a fish?&#8221; demanded the irrepressible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not above a whisper,&#8221; grunted Bob Steele,
trying to bait his hook with his thumb instead of
the bait provided by Phineas. &#8220;Jingo!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>&#8220;Old Bobbins has got the first bite,&#8221; chuckled
Tom, under his breath, as he made his cast.</p>

<p>The reel whirred and the hook fell with a light
splash into a little eddy where the water seemed
to swirl about a sunken rock.</p>

<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t catch anything there,&#8221; said Isadore.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll gag you if you don&#8217;t shut up,&#8221; promised
Tom.</p>

<p>Suddenly his line straightened out. The hook
seemed to be sucked right down into a hole between
the rocks, and the reel began to whir. It
stopped and Tom tried it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pshaw! that ain&#8217;t a bite,&#8221; whispered Isadore.</p>

<p>At Tom&#8217;s first attempt to reel in, the fish that
had seized his hook started&#8211;for Spain! At least,
it shot seaward, and the boy knew that Spain was
about the nearest dry land if the fish kept on in
that direction.</p>

<p>&#8220;A strike!&#8221; Tom gasped and let his reel sing
for a moment or two. Then, when the drag of
the line began to tell on the bass, he carefully
wound in some of it. The fish turned and finally
ran toward the rocks once more. Then Tom
wound up as fast as he could, trying to keep the
line taut.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll tangle you all up, Tommy,&#8221; declared
Bob, unable, like Isadore, to keep entirely still.</p>

<p>Tom was flushed and excited, but said never a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>
word. He played the big bass with coolness after
all, and finally tired it out, keeping it clear of the
tangles of weed down under the rock, and drew
it forth&#8211;a plump, flopping, gasping victim.</p>

<p>Bob and Isadore were then eager to do as well
and began whipping the water about the rocks
with more energy than skill. Tom, delighted with
his first kill, ran over the rocks with the fish to
show it to the girls. As he surmounted the ridge
of the rocky cape he suddenly saw Nita, the runaway,
and Jack Crab, in a little cove right below
him. The girl and the fisherman had come around
to this side of the inlet, away from Phineas and
the other girls.</p>

<p>They did not see Tom behind and above them.
Nita was not fishing, and Crab had unfolded a
paper and was showing it to her. At this distance
the paper seemed like a page torn from some
newspaper, and there were illustrations as well as
reading text upon the sheet which Crab held before
the strange girl&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;There it is!&#8221; Tom heard the lighthouse
keeper&#8217;s assistant say, in an exultant tone. &#8220;You
know what I could get if I wanted to show this to
the right parties. <i>Now</i>, what d&#8217;ye think of it,
Sissy?&#8221;</p>

<p>What Nita thought, or what she said, Tom did
not hear. Indeed, scarcely had the two come into
his line of vision, and he heard these words, when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>
something much farther away&#8211;across the inlet,
in fact&#8211;caught the boy&#8217;s attention.</p>

<p>He could see his sister and some of the other
girls fishing from the rocky path; but directly opposite
where he stood was Ruth. He saw Mary
Cox meet and speak with her, the slight struggle
of the two girls for position on the narrow ledge,
and Ruth&#8217;s plunge into the water.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, by George!&#8221; shouted Tom, as Ruth went
under, and he dropped the flopping bass and went
down the rocks at a pace which endangered both
life and limb. His shout startled Nita and Jack
Crab. But they had not seen Ruth fall, nor did
they understand Tom&#8217;s great excitement.</p>

<p>The inlet was scarcely more than a hundred
yards across; but it was a long way around to
the spot where Ruth had fallen, or been pushed,
from the rock. Tom never thought of going the
long way to the place. He tore off his coat, kicked
off his canvas shoes, and, reaching the edge of the
water, dived in head first without a word of explanation
to the man and girl beside him.</p>

<p>He dived slantingly, and swam under water
for a long way. When he came up he was a
quarter of the distance across the inlet. He shook
the water from his eyes, threw himself breast high
out of the sea, and shouted:</p>

<p>&#8220;Has she come up? I don&#8217;t see her!&#8221;</p>

<p>Nobody but Mary Cox knew what he meant.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>
Helen and the other girls were screaming because
they had seen Tom fling himself into the sea but
they had not seen Ruth fall in.</p>

<p>Nor did Mary Cox find voice enough to tell
them when they ran along the ledge to try and
see what Tom was swimming for. The Fox
stood with glaring eyes, trying to see into the deep
pool. But the pool remain unruffled and Ruth
did not rise to the surface.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has she come up?&#8221; again shouted Tom, rising
as high as he could in the water, and swimming
with an overhand stroke.</p>

<p>There seemed nobody to answer him; they did
not know what he meant. The boy shot through
the water like a fish. Coming near the rock, he
rose up with a sudden muscular effort, then dived
deep. The green water closed over him and,
when Helen and the others reached the spot
where Mary Cox stood, wringing her hands and
moaning, Tom had disappeared as utterly as
Ruth herself.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span><a id='link_16'></a>CHAPTER XVI<br /><span class='h2fs'>RUTH&#8217;S SECRET</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;<span class='sc'>What</span> has happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Ruth?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mary Cox! why don&#8217;t you answer?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Fox for once in her career was stunned.
She could only shake her head and wring her
hands. Helen was the first of the other girls
to suspect the trouble, and she cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ruth&#8217;s overboard! That&#8217;s the reason Tom
has gone in. Oh, oh! why don&#8217;t they come up
again?&#8221;</p>

<p>And almost immediately all the others saw the
importance of that question. Ruth Fielding had
been down fully a minute and a half now, and
Tom had not come up once for air.</p>

<p>Nita had set off running around the head of the
inlet, and Crab shuffled along in her wake. The
strange girl ran like a goat over the rocks.</p>

<p>Phineas, who had been aboard the motor boat
and busy with his famous culinary operations, now
came lumbering up to the spot. He listened to a
chorused explanation of the situation&#8211;tragic indeed
in its appearance. Phineas looked up and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>
down the rocky path, and across the inlet, and
seemed to swiftly take a marine &#8220;observation.&#8221;
Then he snorted.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re all right!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>What?</i>&#8221; shrieked Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right?&#8221; repeated Heavy. &#8220;Why, Phineas<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>She broke off with a startled gurgle. Phineas
turned quickly, too, and looked over the high
boulder. There appeared the head of Ruth
Fielding and, in a moment, the head of Tom
Cameron beside it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You both was swept through the tunnel into
the pool behind, sir,&#8221; said Phineas, wagging his
head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I was never so scared in my life,&#8221; murmured
Ruth, clambering down to the path, the
water running from her clothing in little streams.</p>

<p>&#8220;Me, too!&#8221; grunted Tom, panting. &#8220;The
tide sets in through that hole awfully strong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I might have told you about it,&#8221; grunted
Phineas; &#8220;but I didn&#8217;t suppose airy one of ye was
going for to jump into the sea right here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t&#8211;intentionally,&#8221; declared Ruth.</p>

<p>&#8220;How ever did it happen, Ruthie?&#8221; demanded
Heavy.</p>

<p>There was a moment&#8217;s silence. Tom grew red
in the face, but he kept his gaze turned from
Mary Cox. Ruth answered calmly enough:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>&#8220;It was my own fault. Mary was just coming
along to pass me. I had a bite. Between trying
to let her by and &#8216;tending my fish,&#8217; I fell in&#8211;and
now I have lost fish, line, and all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be thankful you did not lose your life, Miss
Fielding,&#8221; said Aunt Kate. &#8220;Come right down
to the boat and get those wet things off. You,
too, Tom.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment Nita came to the spot. &#8220;Is
she safe? Is she safe?&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t I look so?&#8221; returned Ruth, laughing
gaily. &#8220;And here&#8217;s the fish I <i>did</i> catch. I mustn&#8217;t
lose him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nita stepped close to the girl from the Red
Mill and tugged at her wet sleeve.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do to her?&#8221; she whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do to who?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you talking about?&#8221; demanded
Ruth.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw her,&#8221; said Nita. &#8220;I saw her push
you. She ought to be thrown into the water
herself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; commanded Ruth. &#8220;You&#8217;re mistaken.
You didn&#8217;t see straight, my dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I did,&#8221; declared the Western girl, firmly.
&#8220;She&#8217;s been mean to you, right along. I&#8217;ve noticed
it. She threw you in.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say such a thing again!&#8221; commanded
Ruth, warmly. &#8220;You have no right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; said Nita, eyeing her strangely. &#8220;It&#8217;s
your own business, I suppose. But I am not
blind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope not,&#8221; sad Ruth, calmly. &#8220;But I hope,
too, you will not repeat what you just said&#8211;to
anyone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&#8211;if you really don&#8217;t want me to,&#8221; said
Nita, slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Truly, I don&#8217;t wish you to,&#8221; said Ruth, earnestly.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t even admit that you are right,
mind<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s your secret,&#8221; said Nita, shortly, and
turned away.</p>

<p>And Ruth had a word to say to Tom, too, as
they hurried side by side to the boat, he carrying
the fish. &#8220;Now, Tommy&#8211;remember!&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t be easy in my mind, just the same,
while that girl is here,&#8221; growled Master Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s foolish. She never meant to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! She was scared, of course. But she&#8217;s
mean enough<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop! somebody will hear you. And, anyway,&#8221;
Ruth added, remembering what Nita had
said, &#8220;it&#8217;s <i>my</i> secret.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True enough; it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then don&#8217;t tell it, Tommy,&#8221; she added, with
a laugh.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span>But it was hard to meet the sharp eye of Mercy
Curtis and keep the secret. &#8220;And pray, Miss,
why did you have to go into the water after the
fish?&#8221; Mercy demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was afraid he would get away,&#8221; laughed
Ruth.</p>

<p>&#8220;And who helped you do it?&#8221; snapped the
lame girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Helped me do what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Helped you tumble in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, do you suppose I needed help to do so
silly a thing as that?&#8221; cried Ruth.</p>

<p>&#8220;You needed help to do it the other day on
the steamboat,&#8221; returned Mercy, slily. &#8220;And I
saw The Fox following you around that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, what nonsense you talk, Mercy Curtis!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Ruth wondered if Mercy was to be so
easily put off. The lame girl was so very sharp.</p>

<p>However, Ruth was determined to keep her
secret. Not a word had she said to Mary Cox.
Indeed, she had not looked at her since she
climbed out of the open pool behind the boulder
and, well-nigh breathless, reached the rock after
that perilous plunge. Tom she had sworn to silence,
Nita she had warned to be still, and now
Mercy&#8217;s suspicions were to be routed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor, poor girl!&#8221; muttered Ruth, with more
sorrow than anger. &#8220;If she is not sorry and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>
afraid yet, how will she feel when she awakes in
the night and remembers what might have been?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the girl from the Red Mill did
not allow her secret to disturb her cheerfulness.
She hid any feeling she might have had against
The Fox. When they all met at dinner on the
<i>Miraflame</i>, she merely laughed and joked about
her accident, and passed around dainty bits of
the baked tautog that Phineas had prepared especially
for her.</p>

<p>That fisherman&#8217;s chowder was a marvel, and
altogether he proved to be as good a cook as
Heavy had declared. The boys had caught several
bass, and they caught more after dinner.
But those were saved to take home. The girls,
however, had had enough fishing. Ruth&#8217;s experience
frightened them away from the slippery
rocks.</p>

<p>Mary Cox was certainly a very strange sort of
a girl; but her present attitude did not surprise
Ruth. Mary had, soon after Ruth entered Briarwood
Hall, taken a dislike to the younger girl.
Ruth&#8217;s new club&#8211;the Sweetbriars&#8211;had drawn almost
all the new girls in the school, as well as
many of Mary&#8217;s particular friends; while the Up
and Doing Club, of which Mary was the leading
spirit, was not alone frowned upon by Mrs. Tellingham
and her assistants, but lost members until&#8211;as Helen Cameron
had said&#8211;the last meeting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>
of the Upedes consisted of The Fox and Helen
herself.</p>

<p>The former laid all this at Ruth Fielding&#8217;s
door. She saw Ruth&#8217;s influence and her club increase,
while her own friends fell away from her.
Twice Ruth had helped to save Mary from
drowning, and on neither occasion did the older
girl seem in the least grateful. Now Ruth was
saving her from the scorn of the other girls and&#8211;perhaps&#8211;a
request from Heavy&#8217;s Aunt Kate
that Mary pack her bag and return home.</p>

<p>Ruth hoped that Mary would find some opportunity
of speaking to her alone before the day
was over. But, even when the boys returned from
the outer rocks with a splendid string of bass, and
the bow of the <i>Miraflame</i> was turned homeward,
The Fox said never a word to her. Ruth crept
away into the bows by herself, her mind much
troubled. She feared that the fortnight at Lighthouse
Point might become very unpleasant, if
Mary continued to be so very disagreeable.</p>

<p>Suddenly somebody tapped her on the arm.
The motor boat was pushing toward the mouth of
Sokennet Harbor and the sun was well down toward
the horizon. The girls were in the cabin,
singing, and Madge was trying to make her
brother sing, too; but Bob&#8217;s voice was changing
and what he did to the notes of the familiar tunes
was a caution.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>But it was Tom Cameron who had come to
Ruth. &#8220;See here,&#8221; said the boy, eagerly. &#8220;See
what I picked up on the rocks over there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Over where?&#8221; asked Ruth, looking curiously
at the folded paper in Tom&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Across from where you fell in, Ruth. Nita
and that Crab fellow were standing there when I
went down the rocks and dived in for you. And
I saw them looking at this sheet of newspaper,&#8221;
and Tom began to slowly unfold it as he spoke.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span><a id='link_17'></a>CHAPTER XVII<br /><span class='h2fs'>WHAT WAS IN THE NEWSPAPER</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;<span class='sc'>Whatever</span> have you got there, Tom?&#8221;
asked Ruth, curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush! I reckon Crab lost it when you fell
in the water and stirred us all up so,&#8221; returned
the boy, with a grin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lost that paper?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. You see, it&#8217;s a page torn from the Sunday
edition of a New York daily. On this side
is a story of some professor&#8217;s discoveries in ancient
Babylon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t have interested Jack Crab much,&#8221;
remarked Ruth, smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I said myself,&#8221; declared Tom,
hastily. &#8220;Therefore, I turned it over. And <i>this</i>
is what Crab was showing that Nita girl, I am
sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ruth looked at the illustrated sheet that Tom
spread before her. There was a girl on a very
spirited cow pony, swinging a lariat, the loop of
which was about to settle over the broadly
spreading horns of a Texas steer. The girl was
dressed in a very fancy &#8220;cow-girl&#8221; costume, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>
the picture was most spirited indeed. In one corner,
too, was a reproduction of a photograph of
the girl described in the newspaper article.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why! it doesn&#8217;t look anything like Nita,&#8221;
gasped Ruth, understanding immediately why
Tom had brought the paper to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nope. You needn&#8217;t expect it to. Those papers
use any old photograph to make illustrations
from. But read the story.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was all about the niece of a very rich cattle
man in Montana who had run away from the
ranch on which she had lived all her life. It was
called Silver Ranch, and was a very noted cattle
range in that part of the West. The girl&#8217;s uncle
raised both horses and cattle, was very wealthy,
had given her what attention a single man could
in such a situation, and was now having a countrywide
search made for the runaway.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jane Ann Hicks Has Run Away From a Fortune&#8221;
was the way the paper put it in a big
&#8220;scare head&#8221; across the top of the page; and
the text went on to tell of rough Bill Hicks, of
Bullhide, and how he had begun in the early cattle
days as a puncher himself and had now risen to
the sole proprietorship of Silver Ranch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bill&#8217;s one possession besides his cattle and
horses that he took any joy in was his younger
brother&#8217;s daughter, Jane Ann. She is an orphan
and came to Bill and he has taken sole care of her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>
(for a woman has never been at Silver Ranch,
save Indian squaws and a Mexican cook woman)
since she could creep. Jane Ann is certainly the
apple of Old Bill&#8217;s eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, as Old Bill has told the Bullhide chief
of police, who is sending the pictures and description
of the lost girl all over the country, &#8216;Jane
Ann got some powerful hifalutin&#8217; notions.&#8217; She
is now a well-grown girl, smart as a whip, pretty,
afraid of nothing on four legs, and just as ignorant
as a girl brought up in such an environment
would be. Jane Ann has been reading novels,
perhaps. As the Eastern youth used to fill up on
cheap stories of the Far West, and start for that
wild and woolly section with the intention of wiping
from the face of Nature the last remnant of
the Red Tribes, so it may be that Jane Ann Hicks
has read of the Eastern millionaire and has
started for the Atlantic seaboard for the purpose
of lassoing one&#8211;or more&#8211;of those elusive creatures.</p>

<p>&#8220;However, Old Bill wants Jane Ann to come
home. Silver Ranch will be hers some day, when
Old Bill passes over the Great Divide, and he believes
that if she is to be Montana&#8217;s coming Cattle
Queen his niece would better not know too
much about the effete East.&#8221;</p>

<p>And in this style the newspaper writer had
spread before his readers a semi-humorous account
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>
(perhaps fictitious) of the daily life of the
missing heiress of Silver Ranch, her rides over
the prairies and hills on half-wild ponies, the
round-ups, calf-brandings, horse-breakings, and
all other activities supposed to be part and parcel
of ranch life.</p>

<p>&#8220;My goodness me!&#8221; gasped Ruth, when she
had hastily scanned all this, &#8220;do you suppose that
any sane girl would have run away from all that
for just a foolish whim?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just what I say,&#8221; returned Tom. &#8220;Cracky!
wouldn&#8217;t it be great to ride over that range, and
help herd the cattle, and trail wild horses, and&#8211;and<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s just what one girl got sick of, it
seems,&#8221; finished Ruth, her eyes dancing. &#8220;Now!
whether this same girl is the one we know<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I bet she is,&#8221; declared Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Betting isn&#8217;t proof, you know,&#8221; returned
Ruth, demurely.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. But Jane Ann Hicks is this young lady
who wants to be called &#8216;Nita&#8217;&#8211;Oh, glory! what
a name!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it is so,&#8221; Ruth rejoined, slowly, &#8220;I don&#8217;t
so much wonder that she wanted a fancy name.
&#8216;Jane Ann Hicks&#8217;! It sounds ugly; but an ugly
name can stand for a truly beautiful character.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That fact doesn&#8217;t appeal to this runaway girl,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>
I guess,&#8221; said Tom. &#8220;But the question is: What
shall we do about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know as we can do anything about it,&#8221;
Ruth said, slowly. &#8220;Of course we don&#8217;t know
that this Hicks girl and Nita are the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was Crab showing her the paper for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What can Crab have to do with it, anyway?&#8221;
returned Ruth, although she had not forgotten
the interest the assistant lighthouse keeper had
shown in Nita from the first.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know. But if he recognized her<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From the picture?&#8221; asked Ruth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well! you look at it. That drawing of the
girl on horseback looks more like her than the
photographic half-tone,&#8221; said Tom. &#8220;She looks
just that wild and harum-scarum!&#8221;</p>

<p>Ruth laughed. &#8220;There <i>is</i> a resemblance,&#8221; she
admitted. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t understand why Crab
should have any interest in the girl, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither do I. Let&#8217;s keep still about it. Of
course, we&#8217;ll tell Nell,&#8221; said Tom. &#8220;But nobody
else. If that old ranchman is her uncle he
ought to be told where she is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe she was not happy with him, after all,&#8221;
said Ruth, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;My goodness!&#8221; Tom cried, preparing to go
back to the other boys who were calling him. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t see how anybody could be unhappy under
such conditions.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s all very well for a boy,&#8221; returned the
girl, with a superior air. &#8220;But think! she had
no girls to associate with, and the only women
were squaws and a Mexican cook!&#8221;</p>

<p>Ruth watched Nita, but did not see the assistant
lighthouse keeper speak to the runaway during
the passage home, and from the dock to the
bungalow Ruth walked by Nita&#8217;s side. She was
tempted to show the page of the newspaper to
the other girl, but hesitated. What if Nita
really <i>was</i> Jane Hicks? Ruth asked herself how
<i>she</i> would feel if she were burdened with that
practical but unromantic name, and had to live
on a lonely cattle ranch without a girl to speak
to.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe I&#8217;d run away myself,&#8221; thought Ruth.
&#8220;I was almost tempted to run away from Uncle
Jabez when I first went to live at the Red Mill.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had come to pity the strange girl since
reading about the one who had run away from
Silver Ranch. Whether Nita had any connection
with the newspaper article or not, Ruth had
begun to see that there might be situations which
a girl couldn&#8217;t stand another hour, and from which
she was fairly forced to flee.</p>

<p>The fishing party arrived home in a very gay
mood, despite the incident of Ruth&#8217;s involuntary
bath. Mary Cox kept away from the victim of
the accident and when the others chaffed Ruth,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>
and asked her how she came to topple over the
rock, The Fox did not even change color.</p>

<p>Tom scolded in secret to Ruth about Mary.
&#8220;She ought to be sent home. I&#8217;ll not feel that
you&#8217;re safe any time she is in your company. I&#8217;ve
a mind to tell Miss Kate Stone,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be dreadfully angry if you do such a thing,
Tom,&#8221; Ruth assured him, and that promise was
sufficient to keep the boy quiet.</p>

<p>They were all tired and not even Helen objected
when bed was proposed that night. In
fact, Heavy went to sleep in her chair, and they
had a dreadful time waking her up and keeping
her awake long enough for her to undress, say her
prayers, and get into bed.</p>

<p>In the other girls&#8217; room Ruth and her companions
spent little time in talking or frolicking.
Nita had begged to sleep with Mercy, with whom
she had spent considerable time that day and
evening; and the lame girl and the runaway were
apparently both asleep before Ruth and Helen
got settled for the night.</p>

<p>Then Helen dropped asleep between yawns
and Ruth found herself lying wide-awake, staring
at the faintly illuminated ceiling. Of a sudden,
sleep had fled from her eyelids. The happenings
of the day, the mystery of Nita, the
meanness of Mary Cox, her own trouble at the
mill, the impossibility of her going to Briarwood
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>
next term unless she found some way of raising
money for her tuition and board, and many, many
other thoughts, trooped through Ruth Fielding&#8217;s
mind for more than an hour.</p>

<p>Mostly the troublesome thoughts were of her
poverty and the seeming impossibility of her ever
discovering any way to earn such a quantity of
money as three hundred and fifty dollars. Her
chum, lying asleep beside her, did not dream of
this problem that continually troubled Ruth&#8217;s
mind.</p>

<p>The clock down stairs tolled eleven solemn
strokes. Ruth did not move. She might have
been sound asleep, save for her open eyes, their
gaze fixed upon the ceiling. Suddenly a beam of
light flashed in at one window, swinging from
right to left, like the blade of a phantom scythe,
and back again.</p>

<p>Ruth did not move, but the beam of light took
her attention immediately from her former
thoughts. Again and once again the flash of
light was repeated. Then she suddenly realized
what it was. Somebody was walking down the
path toward the private dock, swinging a lantern.</p>

<p>She would have given it no further thought had
not a door latch clicked. Whether it was the
latch of her room, or another of the bedrooms on
this floor of the bungalow, Ruth could not tell.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>
But in a moment she heard the balustrade of the
stair creak.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Izzy again!&#8221; thought Ruth, sitting up in
bed. &#8220;He&#8217;s walking in his sleep. The boys did
not tie him.&#8221;</p>

<p>She crept out of bed softly so as not to awaken
Helen or the other girls and went to the door.
When she opened it and peered out, there was no
ghostly figure &#8220;tight-roping it&#8221; on the balustrade.
But she heard a sound below&#8211;in the lower hall.
Somebody was fumbling with the chain of the
front door.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s going out! I declare, he&#8217;s going out!&#8221;
thought Ruth and sped to the window.</p>

<p>She heard the jar of the big front door as it
was opened, and then pulled shut again. She
heard no step on the porch, but a figure soon fluttered
down the steps. It was not Isadore Phelps,
however. Ruth knew that at first glance. Indeed,
it was not a boy who started away from the
house, running on the grass beside the graveled
walk.</p>

<p>Ruth turned back hastily and looked at the
other bed&#8211;at Mercy&#8217;s bed. The place beside the
lame girl was empty. Nita had disappeared!</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span><a id='link_18'></a>CHAPTER XVIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>ANOTHER NIGHT ADVENTURE</span></h2>

<p><span class='sc'>Ruth</span> was startled, to say the least, by the discovery
that Nita was absent. And how softly
the runaway girl must have crept out of bed and
out of the room for Ruth&#8211;who had been awake&#8211;not to hear her!</p>

<p>&#8220;She certainly is a sly little thing!&#8221; gasped
Ruth.</p>

<p>But as she turned back to see what had become
of the figure running beside the path, the lantern
light was flashed into her eyes. Again the beam
was shot through the window and danced for a
moment on the wall and ceiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a signal!&#8221; thought Ruth. &#8220;There&#8217;s
somebody outside besides Nita&#8211;somebody who
wishes to communicate with her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Even as she realized this she saw the lantern
flash from the dock. That was where it had been
all the time. It was a dark-lantern, and its ray
had been intentionally shot into the window of
their room.</p>

<p>The figure she had seen steal away from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span>
bungalow had now disappeared. If it was Nita&#8211;as
Ruth believed&#8211;the strange girl might be
hiding in the shadow of the boathouse.</p>

<p>However, the girl from the Red Mill did not
stand idly at the window for long. It came to her
that somebody ought to know what was going on.
Her first thought was that Nita was bent on running
away from her new friends&#8211;although, as
as far as any restraint was put upon her, she might
have walked away at any time.</p>

<p>&#8220;But she ought not to go off like this,&#8221; thought
Ruth, hurrying into her own garments. By the
faint light that came from outside she could see
to dress; and she saw, too, that Nita&#8217;s clothing
had disappeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, the girl must have dressed,&#8221; thought
Ruth, in wonder. &#8220;How could she have done it
with me lying here awake?&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, her own fingers were busy and in
two minutes from the time she had turned from
the window, she opened the hall door again and
tiptoed out.</p>

<p>The house was perfectly still, save for the ticking
of the big clock. She sped down the stairway,
and as she passed the glimmering face of the
time-keeper she glanced at it and saw that the
minute hand was just eight minutes past the hour.</p>

<p>In a closet under the stairs were the girls&#8217; outside
garments, and hats. She found somebody&#8217;s
tam-o&#8217;-shanter and her own sweater-coat, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>
slipped both on in a hurry. When she opened
the door the chill, salt air, with not a little fog in
it, breathed into the close hall.</p>

<p>She stepped out, pulled the door to and latched
it, and crossed the porch. The harbor seemed
deserted. Two or three night lights sparkled
over on the village side. What vessels rode at
anchor showed no lights at their moorings. But
the great, steady, yellow light of the beacon on
the point shone steadily&#8211;a wonderfully comforting
sight, Ruth thought, at this hour of the night.</p>

<p>There were no more flashes of lantern light
from the dock. Nor did she hear a sound from
that direction as she passed out through the trimly
cut privet hedge and took the shell walk to the
boathouse. She was in canvas shoes and her
step made no sound. In a moment or two she
was in the shadow again.</p>

<p>Then she heard voices&#8211;soft, but earnest tones&#8211;and knew that
two people were talking out there
toward the end of the dock. One was a deep
voice; the other might be Nita&#8217;s&#8211;at least, it was
a feminine voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who under the sun can she have come here
to meet?&#8221; wondered Ruth, anxiously. &#8220;Not one
of the boys. This can&#8217;t be merely a lark of some
kind<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Something scraped and squeaked&#8211;a sound that
shattered the silence of the late evening completely.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>
A dog instantly barked back of the
the bungalow, in the kennels. Other dogs on the
far shore of the cove replied. A sleep-walking
rooster began to crow clamorously, believing that
it was already growing day.</p>

<p>The creaking stopped in a minute, and Ruth
heard a faint splash. The voices had ceased.</p>

<p>&#8220;What can it mean?&#8221; thought the anxious girl.
She could remain idle there behind the boathouse
no longer. She crept forth upon the dock to
reconnoiter. There seemed to be nobody there.</p>

<p>And then, suddenly, she saw that the catboat
belonging to Mr. Stone&#8217;s little fleet&#8211;the &#8220;<i>Jennie S.</i>&#8221;
it was called, named for Heavy herself&#8211;was
some distance from her moorings.</p>

<p>The breeze was very light; but the sail was
raised and had filled, and the catboat was drifting
quite rapidly out beyond the end of the dock.
It was so dark in the cockpit that Ruth could not
distinguish whether there were one or two figures
aboard, or who they were; but she realized that
somebody was off on a midnight cruise.</p>

<p>&#8220;And without saying a word about it!&#8221; gasped
Ruth. &#8220;Could it be, after all, one of the boys
and Nita? Are they doing this just for the fun
of it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Yet the heavy voice she had heard did not
sound like that of either of the three boys at the
bungalow. Not even Bob Steele, when his unfortunate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>
voice was pitched in its very lowest key,
could rumble like this voice.</p>

<p>The girl of the Red Mill was both troubled and
frightened. Suppose Nita and her companion
should be wrecked in the catboat? She did not
believe that the runaway girl knew anything about
working a sailboat. And who was her companion
on this midnight escapade? Was he one of the
longshoremen?</p>

<p>Suddenly she thought of Jack Crab. But
Crab was supposed to be at the lighthouse at this
hour; wasn&#8217;t he? She could not remember what
she had heard about the lighthouse keeper&#8217;s assistant.</p>

<p>Nor could Ruth decide at once whether to go
back to the house and give the alarm, or not.
Had she known where Phineas, the boatkeeper,
lodged, she would certainly have tried to awaken
him. He ought to be told that one of the boats
was being used&#8211;and, of course, without permission.</p>

<p>The sail of the catboat drifted out of sight
while she stood there undecided. She could not
pursue the <i>Jennie S.</i> Had she known where
Phineas was, they might have gone after the catboat
in the <i>Miraflame;</i> but otherwise Ruth saw
no possibility of tracking the two people who had
borrowed the <i>Jennie S.</i></p>

<p>Nor was she sure that it was desirable to go in,
awaken the household, and report the disappearance
of Nita. The cruise by night might be a
very innocent affair.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>&#8220;And then again,&#8221; murmured Ruth, &#8220;there
may be something in it deeper than I can see.
We do not really know who this Nita is. That
piece in the paper may not refer to her at all.
Suppose, instead of having run away from a rich
uncle and a big cattle ranch, Nita comes from bad
people? Mrs. Kirby and the captain knew nothing
about her. It may be that some of Nita&#8217;s bad
friends have followed her here, and they may
mean to rob the Stones!</p>

<p>&#8220;Goodness! that&#8217;s a very bad thought,&#8221; muttered
Ruth, shaking her head. &#8220;I ought not to
suspect the girl of anything like that. Although
she is so secret, and so rough of speech, she
doesn&#8217;t seem to be a girl who has lived with really
bad people.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ruth could not satisfy herself that it would be
either right or wise to go in and awaken Miss
Kate, or even the butler. But she could not bring
herself to the point of going to bed, either, while
Nita was out on the water.</p>

<p>She couldn&#8217;t think of sleep, anyway. Not until
the catboat came back to the dock did she move
out of the shadow of the boathouse. And it was
long past one o&#8217;clock when this occurred. The
breeze had freshened, and the <i>Jennie S.</i> had to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span>
tack several times before the boatman made the
moorings.</p>

<p>The starlight gave such slight illumination that
Ruth could not see who was in the boat. The
sail was dropped, the boat moored, and then,
after a bit, she heard a heavy step upon the dock.
Only one person came toward her.</p>

<p>Ruth peered anxiously out of the shadow. A
man slouched along the dock and reached the shell
road. He turned east, moving away toward the
lighthouse. It was Jack Crab.</p>

<p>&#8220;And Nita is not with him!&#8221; gasped Ruth.
&#8220;What has he done with her? Where has he
taken her in the boat? What does it mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>She dared not run after Crab and ask him.
She was really afraid of the man. His secret
communication with Nita was no matter to be
blurted out to everybody, she was sure. Nita
had gone to meet him of her own free will. She
was not obliged to sail away with Crab in the
catboat. Naturally, the supposition was that she
had decided to remain away from the bungalow
of her own intention, too.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not my secret,&#8221; thought Ruth. &#8220;She
was merely a visitor here. Miss Kate, even, had
no command over her actions. She is not responsible
for Nita&#8211;none of us is responsible.</p>

<p>&#8220;I only hope she won&#8217;t get into any trouble
through that horrid Jack Crab. And it seems so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>
ungrateful for Nita to walk out of the house without
saying a word to Heavy and Miss Kate.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d best keep my own mouth shut, however,
and let things take their course. Nita wanted to
go away, or she would not have done so. She
seemed to have no fear of Jack Crab; otherwise
she would not have met him at night and gone
away with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ruth Fielding! you mind your own business,&#8221;
argued the girl of the Red Mill, finally going back
toward the silent house. &#8220;At least, wait until
we see what comes of this before you tell everything
you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so deciding, she crept into the house, locked
the door again, got into her room without disturbing
any of the other girls, and so to bed and
finally to sleep, being little the wiser for her midnight
escapade.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span><a id='link_19'></a>CHAPTER XIX<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE GOBLINS&#8217; GAMBOL</span></h2>

<p><span class='sc'>Helen</span> awoke Ruth in the morning with the
question that was bound to echo and re-echo
through the bungalow for that, and subsequent
days:</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is Nita?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ruth could truthfully answer: &#8220;I do not
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nor did anybody else know, or suspect, or
imagine. What had happened in the night was
known only to Ruth and she had determined not
to say a word concerning it unless she should be
pointedly examined by Miss Kate, or somebody
else in authority.</p>

<p>Nobody else had heard or seen Nita leave
the bungalow. Indeed, nobody had heard Ruth
get up and go out, either. The catboat rocked at
its moorings, and there was no trace of how Nita
had departed.</p>

<p>As to <i>why</i> she had gone so secretly&#8211;well, that
was another matter. They were all of the opinion
that the runaway was a very strange girl.
She had gone without thanking Miss Kate or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>
Heavy for their entertainment. She was evidently
an ungrateful girl.</p>

<p>These opinions were expressed by the bulk of
the party at the bungalow. But Ruth and Helen
and the latter&#8217;s brother had their own secret about
the runaway. Helen had been shown the paper
Tom had found. She and Tom were convinced
that Nita was really Jane Ann Hicks and that she
had been frightened away by Jack Crab. Crab
maybe had threatened her.</p>

<p>On this point Ruth could not agree. But she
could not explain her reason for doubting it without
telling more than she wished to tell; therefore
she did not insist upon her own opinion.</p>

<p>In secret she read over again the article in the
newspaper about the lost Jane Ann Hicks. Something
she had not noticed before now came under
her eye. It was at the end of the article&#8211;at
the bottom of the last column on the page:</p>

<p>&#8220;Old Bill certainly means to find Jane Ann if
he can. He has told Chief Penhampton, of Bullhide,
to spare no expense. The old man says
he&#8217;ll give ten good steers&#8211;or five hundred dollars
in hard money&#8211;for information leading to the apprehension
and return of Jane Ann. And he
thinks some of starting for the East himself to
hunt her up if he doesn&#8217;t hear soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That poor old man,&#8221; thought Ruth, &#8220;really
loves his niece. If I was sure Nita was the girl
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span>
told of here, I&#8217;d be tempted to write to Mr. Hicks
myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>But there was altogether too much to do at
Lighthouse Point for the young folks to spend
much time worrying about Nita. Phineas said
that soft-shell crabs were to be found in abundance
at the mouth of the creek at the head of the cove,
and that morning the boys made nets for all hands&#8211;at least,
they found the poles and fastened the
hoops to them, while the girls made the bags of
strong netting&#8211;and after dinner the whole party
trooped away (Mercy excepted) to heckle the
crabs under the stones and snags where Phineas
declared they would be plentiful.</p>

<p>The girls were a bit afraid of the creatures at
first, when they were shaken out of the scoops;
but they soon found that the poor things couldn&#8217;t
bite until the new shells hardened. The boys
took off their shoes and stockings and waded in,
whereupon Bob suddenly began to dance and bawl
and splash the water all over himself and his companions.</p>

<p>&#8220;What under the sun&#8217;s the matter with you,
Bobbins?&#8221; roared Tom, backing away from his
friend to escape a shower-bath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! he&#8217;s got a fit!&#8221; squealed Isadore.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s cramps!&#8221; declared Heavy, from the
shore, and in great commiseration.</p>

<p>&#8220;For pity&#8217;s sake, little boy!&#8221; cried Bob&#8217;s sister,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>
&#8220;what is the matter with you now? He&#8217;s
the greatest child! always getting into some
mess.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob continued to dance; but he got into shoal
water after a bit and there it was seen that he was
doing a sort of Highland fling on one foot. The
other had attached to it a big hardshell crab; and
no mortgage was ever clamped upon a poor man&#8217;s
farm any tighter than Mr. Crab was fastened
upon Bob&#8217;s great toe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!&#8221; repeated the big fellow,
whacking away at the crab with the handle of
his net.</p>

<p>Isadore tried to aid him, and instead of hitting
the crab with <i>his</i> stick, barked Bob&#8217;s ankle bone
nicely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ow! Ow! Ow!&#8221; yelled the youth in an entirely
different key.</p>

<p>The girls were convulsed with laughter; but
Tom got the big crab and the big boy apart. Bob
wasn&#8217;t satisfied until he had placed the hardshell
between two stones and wrecked it&#8211;smashed it
flat as a pancake.</p>

<p>&#8220;There! I know that fellow will never nip
another inoffensive citizen,&#8221; groaned Bob, and he
sat on a stone and nursed his big toe and his
bruised ankle until the others were ready to go
home.</p>

<p>They got a nice mess of crabs; but Bob refused
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>
to eat any. &#8220;Never want to see even crabs <i>a la</i>
Newburgh again,&#8221; he grunted. &#8220;And I don&#8217;t believe
that even a fried soft-shell crab is dead
enough so that it can&#8217;t bite a fellow!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a splendid smooth bit of beach beyond
the dock where they bathed, and even
Mercy had taken a dip that morning; but when
the girls went to their bedrooms at night each
girl found pinned to her nightdress a slip of paper&#8211;evidently
a carbon copy of a typewritten
message. It read:</p>

<div class='bquote'>
<p>&#8220;THE GOBLINS&#8217; GAMBOL&#8211;You are instructed
to put on your bathing suit, take a wrap,
and meet for a Goblins&#8217; Gambol on the beach at
ten sharp. The tide will be just right, and there
is a small moon. Do not fail.&#8221;</p>
</div> <!-- block quote -->

<p>The girls giggled a good deal over this. They
all declared they had not written the message, or
caused it to be written. There was a typewriter
downstairs, Heavy admitted; but she had never
used it. Anyhow, the suggestion was too tempting
to refuse.</p>

<p>At ten the girls, shrouded in their cloaks and
water proofs, crept down stairs and out of the
house. The door was locked, and they could not
imagine who had originated this lark. The boys
did not seem to be astir at all.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>&#8220;If Aunt Kate hears of this I expect she&#8217;ll say
something,&#8221; chuckled Heavy. &#8220;But we&#8217;ve been
pretty good so far. Oh, it is just warm and nice.
I bet the water will be fine.&#8221;</p>

<p>They trooped down to the beach, Mercy limping
along with the rest. Ruth and Helen gave
her aid when she reached the sand, for her
crutches hampered her there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on! the water&#8217;s fine!&#8221; cried Madge,
running straight into the smooth sea.</p>

<p>They were soon sporting in it, and having a
great time, but keeping near the shore because
the boys were not there, when suddenly Helen
began to squeal&#8211;and then Madge. Those two
likewise instantly disappeared beneath the water,
their cries ending in articulate gurgles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Oh!&#8221; cried Heavy. &#8220;There&#8217;s somebody
here! Something&#8217;s got me!&#8221;</p>

<p>She was in shallow water, and she promptly sat
down. Whatever had grabbed her vented a
mighty grunt, for she pinioned it for half a minute
under her weight. When she could scramble
up she had to rescue what she had fallen on, and
it proved to be Isadore&#8211;very limp and &#8220;done up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the boys,&#8221; squealed Helen, coming to the
surface. &#8220;Tom swam under water and caught
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And this is that horrid Bob!&#8221; cried Madge.
&#8220;What have you got there, Heavy?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>&#8220;I really don&#8217;t know,&#8221; giggled the stout girl.
&#8220;What do you think it looks like?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My&#8211;goodness&#8211;me!&#8221; panted Busy Izzy.
&#8220;I thought&#8211;it&#8211;it was Ruth! Why&#8211;why don&#8217;t
you look where you&#8217;re sitting, Jennie Stone?&#8221;</p>

<p>But the laugh was on Isadore and he could not
turn the tables. The boys had been out to the
diving float watching the girls come in. And in
a minute or two Miss Kate joined them, too. It
was she who had planned the moonlight dip and
for half an hour they ran races on the sand, and
swam, and danced, and had all sorts of queer
larks.</p>

<p>Miss Kate was about to call them out and
&#8220;shoo&#8221; the whole brood into the house again
when they heard a horse, driven at high speed,
coming over the creek bridge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo! here comes somebody in a hurry,&#8221;
said Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. He&#8217;s driving this way, not toward
the railroad station,&#8221; rejoined Heavy.
&#8220;It&#8217;s somebody from Sokennet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who can it be this time of night?&#8221; was her
aunt&#8217;s question as they waited before the gateway
as the carriage wheeled closer.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a telegraph office, you know, at Sokennet,&#8221;
said Heavy, thoughtfully. &#8220;And&#8211;yes!&#8211;that&#8217;s Brickman&#8217;s old
horse. Hullo!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whoa! Hullo, Miss!&#8221; exclaimed a hoarse
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>
voice. &#8220;Glad I found you up. Here&#8217;s a message
for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For me?&#8221; cried Heavy, and dripping as she
was, ran out to the carriage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sign on this place, Miss. Here&#8217;s a pencil.
Thank you, Miss; it&#8217;s paid for. That&#8217;s the
message,&#8221; and he put a telegraph envelope into
her hand.</p>

<p>On the outside of the envelope was written,
&#8220;Stone, Lighthouse Point.&#8221; Under the lamp on
the porch Heavy broke the seal and drew out the
message, while the whole party stood waiting.
She read it once to herself, and was evidently immensely
surprised. Then she read it out loud,
and her friends were just as surprised as she was:</p>

<div class='bquote'>
<p>&#8220;Stone, Lighthouse Point, Sokennet.&#8211;Hold
onto her. I am coming right down.

<p><span class='sc'>Three</span> of Heavy&#8217;s listeners knew in an instant
what the telegram meant&#8211;who it was from, and
who was mentioned in it&#8211;Ruth, Helen and Tom.
But how, or why the telegram had been sent was
as great a mystery to them as to the others;
therefore their surprise was quite as unfeigned as
that of the remaining girls and boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, somebody&#8217;s made a mistake,&#8221; said
Heavy. &#8220;Such a telegram couldn&#8217;t be meant for
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And addressed only to &#8216;Stone,&#8217;&#8221; said her aunt.
&#8220;It is, of course, a mistake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And who are we to hold on to?&#8221; laughed
Mary Cox, prepared to run into the house again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait!&#8221; cried Mercy, who had come leaning
upon Madge&#8217;s arm from the shore. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you
see who that message refers to?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; they chorused.</p>

<p>&#8220;To that runaway girl, of course,&#8221; said the
cripple. &#8220;That&#8217;s plain enough, I hope.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To Nita!&#8221; gasped Heavy.</p>

<p>&#8220;But who is it that&#8217;s coming here for her?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>
And how did &#8216;W. Hicks&#8217; know she was here?&#8221;
demanded Ruth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe Captain and Mrs. Kirby told all about
her when they got to Boston. News of her, and
where she was staying, got to her friends,&#8221; said
Mercy Curtis. &#8220;That&#8217;s the &#8216;why and wherefore&#8217;
of it&#8211;believe me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That sounds very reasonable,&#8221; admitted
Aunt Kate. &#8220;The Kirbys would only know our
last name and would not know how to properly
address either Jennie or me. Come, now! get in
on the rubber mats in your rooms and rub down
well. The suits will be collected and rinsed out
and hung to dry before Mammy Laura goes to
bed. If any of you feel the least chill, let me
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>But it was so warm and delightful a night that
there was no danger of colds. The girls were so
excited by the telegram and had so much to say
about the mystery of Nita, the castaway, that it
was midnight before any of them were asleep.</p>

<p>However, they had figured out that the writer
of the telegram, leaving New York, from which
it was sent at half after eight, would be able to
take a train that would bring him to Sandtown
very early in the morning; and so the excited
young folks were all awake by five o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p>It was a hazy morning, but there was a good
breeze from the land. Tom declared he heard
the train whistle for the Sandtown station, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>
everybody dressed in a hurry, believing that &#8220;W. Hicks&#8221; would soon be
at the bungalow.</p>

<p>There were no public carriages at the station
to meet that early train, and Miss Kate had
doubted about sending anybody to meet the person
who had telegraphed. In something like an
hour, however, they saw a tall man, all in black,
striding along the sandy road toward the house.</p>

<p>As he came nearer he was seen to be a big-boned
man, with broad shoulders, long arms, and
a huge reddish mustache, the ends of which
drooped almost to his collar. Such a mustache
none of them had ever seen before. His black
clothes would have fitted a man who weighed a
good fifty pounds more than he did, and so the
garments hung baggily upon him. He wore a
huge, black slouched hat, with immensely broad
brim.</p>

<p>He strode immediately to the back door&#8211;that
being the nearest to the road by which he came&#8211;and
the boys and girls in the breakfast room
crowded to the windows to see him. He looked
neither to right nor left, however, but walked
right into the kitchen, where they at once heard
a thunderous voice demand:</p>

<p>&#8220;Whar&#8217;s my Jane Ann? Whar&#8217;s my Jane
Ann, I say?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mammy Laura evidently took his appearance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>
and demand in no good part. She began to
sputter, but his heavy voice rode over hers and
quenched it:</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep still, ol&#8217; woman! I want to see your
betters. Whar&#8217;s my Jane Ann?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lawsy massy! what kine ob a man is yo&#8217;?&#8221;
squealed the fat old colored woman. &#8220;T&#8217; come
combustucatin&#8217; inter a pusson&#8217;s kitchen in disher
way<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be still, ol&#8217; woman!&#8221; roared the visitor again.
&#8220;Whar&#8217;s my Jane Ann?&#8221;</p>

<p>The butler appeared then and took the strange
visitor in hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come this way, sir. Miss Kate will see you,&#8221;
he said, and led the big man into the front of the
house.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want none o&#8217; your &#8216;Miss Kates,&#8217;&#8221;
growled the stranger. &#8220;I want my Jane Ann.&#8221;</p>

<p>Heavy&#8217;s little Aunt looked very dainty indeed
when she appeared before this gigantic Westerner.
The moment he saw her, off came his big
hat, displaying a red, freckled face, and a head
as bald as an egg. He was a very ugly man, saving
when he smiled; then innumerable humorous
wrinkles appeared about his eyes and the pale
blue eyes themselves twinkled confidingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your sarvent, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Your
name Stone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is, sir. I presume you are &#8216;W. Hicks&#8217;?&#8221;
she said.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s me&#8211;Bill Hicks. Bill Hicks, of Bullhide,
Montanny.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you have not come here, Mr. Hicks,
to be disappointed. But I must tell you at the
start,&#8221; said Miss Kate, &#8220;that I never heard of
you before <i>I</i> received your very remarkable telegram.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! that can well be, ma&#8217;am&#8211;that can well
be. But they got your letter at the ranch, and
Jib, he took it into Colonel Penhampton, and the
Colonel telegraphed me to New York, where I&#8217;d
come a-hunting her<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait, wait, wait!&#8221; cried Miss Kate, eagerly.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand at all what you are talking
about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&#8211;why, I&#8217;m aimin&#8217; to talk about my Jane
Ann,&#8221; exclaimed the cattle man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jane Ann who?&#8221; she gasped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jane Ann Hicks. My little gal what you&#8217;ve
got her and what you wrote about<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are misinformed, sir,&#8221; declared Miss
Kate. &#8220;I have never written to you&#8211;or to anybody
else&#8211;about any person named Jane Ann
Hicks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, mebbe you don&#8217;t know her by that name.
She had some hifalutin&#8217; idee before she vamoosed
about not likin&#8217; her name&#8211;an&#8217; I give her that
thar name myself!&#8221; added Bill Hicks, in an
aggrieved tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor have I written about any other little girl,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span>
or by any other name,&#8221; rejoined Miss Kate. &#8220;I
have written no letter at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t write to Silver Ranch to tell us
that my little Jane Ann was found?&#8221; gasped the
man.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Somebody else wrote, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know it, if they did,&#8221; Miss Kate declared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then somebody&#8217;s been a-stringin&#8217; of me?&#8221;
he roared, punching his big hat with a clenched,
freckled fist in a way that made Miss Kate jump.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you be afeared, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; said the big
man, more gently. &#8220;But I&#8217;m mighty cast down&#8211;I sure am! Some
miser&#8217;ble coyote has fooled
me. That letter said as how my little niece was
wrecked on a boat here and that a party named
Stone had taken her into their house at Lighthouse
Point<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Nita!&#8221; cried Miss Kate.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re speaking of Nita, the castaway!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m talkin&#8217; of my niece, Jane Ann Hicks,&#8221; declared
the rancher. &#8220;That&#8217;s who I&#8217;m talking of.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But she called herself Nita, and would not tell
us anything about herself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It might be, ma&#8217;am. The little skeezicks!&#8221;
chuckled the Westerner, his eyes twinkling suddenly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>
&#8220;That&#8217;s a mighty fancy name&#8211;&#8216;Nita.&#8217;
And so she <i>is</i> here with you, after all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not here?&#8221; he exclaimed, his big, bony face
reddening again.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir. I believe she has been here&#8211;your
niece.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And where&#8217;d she go? What you done
with her?&#8221; he demanded, his overhanging reddish
eyebrows coming together in a threatening
scowl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hadn&#8217;t you better sit down, Mr. Hicks, and
let me tell you all about it?&#8221; suggested Miss
Kate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Miss!&#8221; he ejaculated. &#8220;I&#8217;m anxious, I
be. When Jane Ann first run away from Silver
Ranch, I thought she was just a-playin&#8217; off some
of her tricks on me. I never supposed she was
in earnest &#8217;bout it&#8211;no, ma&#8217;am!</p>

<p>&#8220;I rid into Bullhide arter two days. And instead
of findin&#8217; her knockin&#8217; around there, I finds
her pony at the greaser&#8217;s corral, and learns that
she&#8217;s took the train East. That did beat me. I
didn&#8217;t know she had any money, but she&#8217;d bought
a ticket to Denver, and it took a right smart of
money to do it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I went to Colonel Penhampton, I did,&#8221; went
on Hicks, &#8220;and told him about it. He heated up
the wires some &#8217;twixt Bullhide and Denver; but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>
she&#8217;d fell out o&#8217; sight there the minute she&#8217;d
landed. Denver&#8217;s some city, ma&#8217;am. I finds
that out when I lit out arter Jane Ann and struck
that place myself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal! &#8217;twould be teejious to you, ma&#8217;am, if I
told whar I have chased arter that gal these endurin&#8217;
two months. Had to let the ranch an&#8217;
ev&#8217;rythin&#8217; else go to loose ends while I follered
news of her all over. My gosh, ma&#8217;am! how
many gals there is runs away from their homes!
Ye wouldn&#8217;t believe the number &#8217;nless ye was
huntin&#8217; for a pertic&#8217;lar one an&#8217; got yer rope on
so many that warn&#8217;t her!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have had many disappointments, sir?&#8221;
said Miss Kate, beginning to feel a great sympathy
for this uncouth man.</p>

<p>He nodded his great, bald, shining head. &#8220;I
hope you ain&#8217;t going to tell me thar&#8217;s another in
store for me right yere,&#8221; he said, in a much
milder voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot tell you where Nita&#8211;if she is your
niece&#8211;is now,&#8221; said Miss Kate, firmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s left you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She went away some time during the night&#8211;night
before last.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221; he asked, suspiciously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. We none of us knew. We
made her welcome and said nothing about sending
her away, or looking for her friends. I did
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>
not wish to frighten her away, for she is a
strangely independent girl<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet she is!&#8221; declared Mr. Hicks, emphatically.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hoped she would gradually become confiding,
and then we could really do something for
her. But when we got up yesterday morning she
had stolen out of the house in the night and was
gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And ye don&#8217;t know whar Jane Ann went?&#8221;
he said, with a sort of groan.</p>

<p>Miss Kate shook her head; but suddenly a
voice interrupted them. Ruth Fielding parted
the curtains and came into the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you will pardon me, Miss Kate,&#8221; she
said softly. &#8220;And this gentleman, too. I believe
I can tell him how Nita went away&#8211;and perhaps
through what I know he may be able to find
her again.&#8221;</p>

&#8220;That New York newspaper&#8211;with
the picter of Jane Ann on a pony what looked like
one o&#8217; these horsecar horses? Most ev&#8217;rythin&#8217;
they said in that paper was true about her&#8211;and
the ranch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And she has had to live out there without any
decent woman, and no girls to play with, and all
that?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>&#8220;Wal!&#8221; exclaimed Mr. Hicks. &#8220;That ain&#8217;t
sech a great crime; is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wonder so much she ran away,&#8221; Ruth
said, softly. &#8220;But I am sorry she did not stay
here until you came, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But where is she?&#8221; chorused both the ranchman
and Miss Kate, and the latter added: &#8220;Tell
what you know about her departure, Ruth.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Ruth repeated all that she had heard and
seen on the night Nita disappeared from the
Stone bungalow.</p>

<p>&#8220;And this man, Crab, can be found down yonder
at the lighthouse?&#8221; demanded the ranchman,
rising at the end of Ruth&#8217;s story.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is there part of the time, sir,&#8221; Miss Kate
said. &#8220;He is a rather notorious character around
here&#8211;a man of bad temper, I believe. Perhaps
you had better go to the authorities first<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What authorities?&#8221; demanded the Westerner
in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Sokennet police.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bill Hicks snorted. &#8220;I don&#8217;t need police in
this case, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I know what to do
with this here Crab when I find him. And if
harm&#8217;s come to my Jane Ann, so much the worse
for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I hope you will be patient, sir,&#8221; said Miss
Kate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nita was not a bit afraid of him, I am
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>
sure,&#8221; Ruth hastened to add. &#8220;He would not
hurt her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I reckon he wants to make money out
of me,&#8221; grunted Bill Hicks, who did not lack
shrewdness. &#8220;He sent the letter that told me
she was here, and then he decoyed her away somewhere
so&#8217;s to hold her till I came and paid him
the reward. Wal! let me git my Jane Ann back,
safe and sound, and he&#8217;s welcome to the five hundred
dollars I offered for news of her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But first, Mr. Hicks,&#8221; said Miss Kate, rising
briskly, &#8220;you&#8217;ll come to breakfast. You have
been traveling all night<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, ma&#8217;am. No chance for more
than a peck at a railroad sandwich&#8211;tough critters,
them!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! here is Tom Cameron,&#8221; she said, having
parted the portières and found Tom just passing
through the hall. &#8220;Mr. Hicks, Tom. Nita&#8217;s
uncle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Er&#8211;Mr. Bill Hicks, of the Silver Ranch!&#8221;
ejaculated Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;ve hearn tell of me, too, have you,
younker?&#8221; quoth the ranchman, good-naturedly.
&#8220;Well, my fame&#8217;s spreadin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And it seems that <i>I</i> am the only person here
who did not know all about your niece,&#8221; said Miss
Kate Stone, drily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, ma&#8217;am!&#8221; cried Tom. &#8220;It was only
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>
Ruth and Helen and I who knew anything about
it. And we only suspected. You see, we found
the newspaper article which told about that bully
ranch, and the fun that girl had<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jane Ann didn&#8217;t think &#8217;twas nice enough for
her,&#8221; grunted the ranchman. &#8220;She wanted high-heeled
slippers&#8211;and shift&#8211;shift-on hats&#8211;and a
pianner! Common things warn&#8217;t good enough
for Jane Ann.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ruth laughed, for she wasn&#8217;t at all afraid of the
big Westerner. &#8220;If chiffon hats and French
heeled slippers would have kept Nita&#8211;I mean,
Jane Ann&#8211;at home, wouldn&#8217;t it have been cheaper
for you to have bought &#8217;em?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;It shore would!&#8221; declared the cattleman, emphatically.
&#8220;But when the little girl threatened
to run away I didn&#8217;t think she meant it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile Miss Kate had asked Tom to take
the big man up stairs where he could remove the
marks of travel. In half an hour he was at the
table putting away a breakfast that made even
Mammy Laura open her eyes in wonder.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a heavy feeder, Miss,&#8221; he said apologetically,
to Ruth. &#8220;Since I been East I often have
taken my breakfast in two restaurants, them air
waiters stare so. I git it in relays, as ye might
say. Them restaurant people ain&#8217;t used to seeing
a <i>man</i> eat. And great cats! how they do
charge for vittles!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>But ugly as he was, and big and rude as he was,
there was a simplicity and open-heartedness about
Mr. Hicks that attracted more than Ruth Fielding.
The boys, because Tom was enthusiastic
about the old fellow, came in first. But the girls
were not far behind, and by the time Mr. Hicks
had finished breakfast the whole party was in the
room, listening to his talk of his lost niece, and
stories of Silver Ranch and the growing and
wonderful West.</p>

<p>Mercy Curtis, who had a sharp tongue and a
sharper insight into character, knew just how to
draw Bill Hicks out. And the ranchman, as soon
as he understood that Mercy was a cripple, paid
her the most gallant attentions. And he took the
lame girl&#8217;s sharp criticisms in good part, too.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you thought you could bring up a girl
baby from the time she could crawl till she was
old enough to get married&#8211;eh?&#8221; demanded
Mercy, in her whimsical way. &#8220;What a smart
man you are, Mr. Bill Hicks!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ya-as&#8211;ain&#8217;t I?&#8221; he groaned. &#8220;I see now
I didn&#8217;t know nothin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a living thing!&#8221; agreed Mercy. &#8220;Bringing
up a girl among a lot of cow&#8211;cow&#8211;what do
you call &#8217;em?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Punchers,&#8221; he finished, wagging his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it. Nice society for a girl. Likely to
make her ladylike and real happy, too.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>&#8220;Great cats!&#8221; ejaculated the ranchman, &#8220;I
thought I was doin&#8217; the square thing by Jane
Ann<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And giving her a name like that, too!&#8221; broke
in Mercy. &#8220;How dared you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&#8211;why<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221; stammered Mr. Hicks.
&#8220;It was my grandmother&#8217;s name&#8211;and she was as
spry a woman as ever I see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your grandmother&#8217;s name!&#8221; gasped Mercy.
&#8220;Then, what right had you to give it to your
niece? And when she way a helpless baby, too!
Wasn&#8217;t she good enough to have a name of her
own&#8211;and one a little more modern?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss, you stump me&#8211;you sure do!&#8221; declared
Mr. Hicks, with a sigh. &#8220;I never thought
a gal cared so much for them sort o&#8217; things.
They&#8217;re surprisin&#8217; different from boys; ain&#8217;t
they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hope you haven&#8217;t found it out too late,
Mister Wild and Woolly,&#8221; said Mercy, biting her
speech off in her sharp way. &#8220;You had better
take a fashion magazine and buy Nita&#8211;or whatever
she wants to call herself&#8211;clothes and hats
like other girls wear. Maybe you&#8217;ll be able to
keep her on a ranch, then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, Miss! I&#8217;m bound to believe you&#8217;ve got
the rights of it. I ain&#8217;t never had much knowledge
of women-folks, and that&#8217;s a fact<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>He was interrupted by the maid coming to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>
door. &#8220;There&#8217;s a boy here, Miss Kate,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;who is asking for the gentleman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Asking for the gentleman?&#8221; repeated Miss
Kate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am. The gentleman who has just
came. The gentleman from the West.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Axing for <i>me?</i>&#8221; cried the ranchman, getting
up quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be for you, sir,&#8221; said Aunt Kate.
&#8220;Let the boy come in, Sally.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a minute a shuffling, tow-headed, bare-footed
lad of ten years or so entered bashfully. He
was a son of one of the fishermen living along
the Sokennet shore.</p>

<p>&#8220;You wanter see me, son?&#8221; demanded the
Westerner. &#8220;Bill Hicks, of Bullhide?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dunno wot yer name is, Mister,&#8221; said the
boy. &#8220;But air you lookin&#8217; for a gal that was
brought ashore from the wreck of that lumber
schooner?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s me!&#8221; cried Mr. Hicks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I got suthin&#8217; for ye,&#8221; said the boy, and
thrust a soiled envelope toward him. &#8220;Jack
Crab give it to me last night. He said I was to
come over this morning an&#8217; wait for you to come.
Phin says you had come, w&#8217;en I got here. That&#8217;s
all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on!&#8221; cried Tom Cameron, as the boy
started to go out, and Mr. Hicks ripped open
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>
the envelope. &#8220;Say, where is this Crab man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dunno.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did he go after giving you the note?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dunno.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then Mr. Hicks uttered an exclamation
that drew all attention to him and the fisherman&#8217;s
boy slipped out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great cats!&#8221; roared Bill Hicks. &#8220;Listen to
this, folks! What d&#8217;ye make of it?</p>

<div class='bquote'>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Now I got you right. Whoever you be,
you are wanting to get hold of the girl. I
know where she is. You won&#8217;t never know unless
I get that five hundred dols. The paper talked
about. You leave it at the lighthouse. Mis
Purling will take care of it and I reckon on getting
it from her when I want it. When she has
got the five hundred dols. I will let you know
how to find the girl. So, no more at present,
from</p>
</div> <!-- block quote -->
<p class='tar sc'>&#8220;&#8216;J. Crab.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen here to it, will ye? Why, if once I
get my paws on this here Crab<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You want to get the girl most; don&#8217;t you?&#8221;
interrupted Mercy, sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;d better see if paying the money to
him&#8211;just as he says&#8211;won&#8217;t bring her to you.
You offered the reward, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>&#8220;But maybe he doesn&#8217;t really know anything
about Nita!&#8221; cried Heavy.</p>

<p>&#8220;And maybe he knows just where she is,&#8221; said
Ruth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal! he seems like a mighty sharp feller,&#8221;
admitted the cattleman, seriously. &#8220;I want my
Jane Ann back. I don&#8217;t begredge no five hundred
dollars. I&#8217;m a-goin&#8217; over to that lighthouse and
see what this Missus Purling&#8211;you say she&#8217;s the
keeper?&#8211;knows about it. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going
to do!&#8221; finished Hicks with emphasis.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span><a id='link_22'></a>CHAPTER XXII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THIMBLE ISLAND</span></h2>

<p><span class='sc'>Miss Kate</span> said of course he could use the
buckboard and ponies, and it was the ranchman&#8217;s
own choice that the young folks went, too. There
was another wagon, and they could all crowd
aboard one or the other vehicle&#8211;even Mercy Curtis
went.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe that Crab man will show up
at the light,&#8221; Ruth said to Tom and Helen.
&#8220;He&#8217;s plainly made up his mind that he won&#8217;t
meet Nita&#8217;s friends personally. And to think of
his getting five hundred dollars so easy!&#8221; and she
sighed.</p>

<p>For the reward Mr. Hicks had offered for news
of his niece, which would lead to her apprehension
and return to his guardianship, would have entirely
removed from Ruth Fielding&#8217;s mind her
anxiety about Briarwood. Let the Tintacker
Mine, in which Uncle Jabez had invested, remain
a deep and abiding mystery, if Ruth could earn
that five hundred dollars.</p>

<p>But if Jack Crab had placed Nita in good hands
and was merely awaiting an opportunity to exchange
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>
her for the reward which the runaway&#8217;s
uncle had offered, then Ruth need not hope for
any portion of the money. And certainly, Crab
would make nothing by hiding the girl away and
refusing to give her up to Mr. Hicks.</p>

<p>&#8220;And if I took money for telling Mr. Hicks
where Nita was, why&#8211;why it would be almost
like taking blood money! Nita liked me, I believe;
I think she ought to be with her uncle, and
I am sure he is a nice man. But it would be playing
the traitor to report her to Mr. Hicks&#8211;and
that&#8217;s a fact!&#8221; concluded Ruth, taking herself to
task. &#8220;I could not think of earning money in
such a contemptible way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whether her conclusion was right, or not, it
seemed right to Ruth, and she put the thought of
the reward out of her mind from that instant.
The ranchman had taken a liking to Ruth and
when he climbed into the buckboard he beckoned
the girl from the Red Mill to a seat beside him.
He drove the ponies, but seemed to give those
spirited little animals very little attention. Ruth
knew that he must be used to handling horses beside
which the ponies seemed like tame rabbits.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now what do you think of my Jane Ann?&#8221;
was the cattleman&#8217;s question. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t she pretty
cute?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not quite sure that I know what you
mean by that, Mr. Hicks,&#8221; Ruth answered, demurely.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>
&#8220;But she isn&#8217;t as smart as she ought to
be, or she wouldn&#8217;t have gone off with Jack
Crab.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; grunted the other. &#8220;Mebbe you&#8217;re
right on that p&#8217;int. He didn&#8217;t have no drop on
her&#8211;that&#8217;s so! But ye can&#8217;t tell what sort of a
yarn he give her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She would better have had nothing to say to
him,&#8221; said Ruth, emphatically. &#8220;She should
have confided in Miss Kate. Miss Kate and Jennie
were treating her just as nicely as though she
were an invited guest. Nita&#8211;or Jane, as you call
her&#8211;may be smart, but she isn&#8217;t grateful in the
least.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, come now, Miss<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. She isn&#8217;t grateful,&#8221; repeated Ruth.
&#8220;She never even suggested going over to the life
saving station and thanking Cap&#8217;n Abinadab and
his men for bringing her ashore from the wreck
of the <i>Whipstitch.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Great cats! I been thinkin&#8217; of that,&#8221; sighed
the Westerner. &#8220;I want to see them and tell &#8217;em
what I think of &#8217;em. I &#8217;spect Jane Ann never
thought of such a thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I liked her, just the same,&#8221; Ruth went
on, slowly. &#8220;She was bold, and brave, and I
guess she wouldn&#8217;t ever do a really mean thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon not, Miss!&#8221; agreed Mr. Hicks.
&#8220;My Jane Ann is plumb square, she is. I can
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>
forgive her for running away from us. Mebbe
thar was reason for her gittin&#8217; sick of Silver
Ranch. I&#8211;I stand ready to give her &#8217;bout
ev&#8217;rything she wants&#8211;in reason&#8211;when I git her
back thar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Including a piano?&#8221; asked Ruth, curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great cats! that&#8217;s what we had our last spat
about,&#8221; groaned Bill Hicks. &#8220;Jib, he&#8217;s had advantages,
he has. Went to this here Carlisle
Injun school ye hear so much talk about. It
purty nigh ruined him, but he <i>can</i> break hosses.
And thar he l&#8217;arned to play one o&#8217; them pianners.
We was all in to Bullhide one time&#8211;we&#8217;d been
shipping steers&#8211;and we piled into the Songbird
Dancehall&#8211;had the place all to ourselves, for it
was daytime&#8211;and Jib sot down and fingered them
keys somethin&#8217; scand&#8217;lous. Bashful Ike&#8211;he&#8217;s my
foreman&#8211;says he never believed before that a
sure &#8217;nough man like Jibbeway Pottoway could
ever be so ladylike!</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal! My Jane Ann was jest enchanted by
that thar pianner&#8211;yes, Miss! She was jest enchanted.
And she didn&#8217;t give me no peace from
then on. Said she wanted one o&#8217; the critters at
the ranch so Jib could give her lessons. And I
jest thought it was foolishness&#8211;and it cost money&#8211;oh, well!
I see now I was a pretty mean old
hunks<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I heard her call you once,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>
chuckled Ruth. &#8220;At least, I know now that she
was speaking of you, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She hit me off right,&#8221; sighed Mr. Hicks. &#8220;I
hadn&#8217;t never been used to spending money. But,
laws, child! I got enough. I been some waked
up since I come East. Folks spend money here,
that&#8217;s a fact.&#8221;</p>

<p>They found Mother Purling&#8217;s door opened at
the foot of the lighthouse shaft, and the flutter of
an apron on the balcony told them that the old
lady had climbed to the lantern.</p>

<p>&#8220;She doesn&#8217;t often do that,&#8221; said Heavy.
&#8220;Crab does all the cleaning and polishing up
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s left her without any help, then,&#8221; Ruth
suggested. &#8220;That&#8217;s what it means.&#8221;</p>

<p>And truly, that is what it did mean, as they
found out when Ruth, the Cameron twins, and
the Westerner climbed the spiral staircase to the
gallery outside the lantern.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; that Crab ain&#8217;t been here this morning,&#8221;
Mother Purling admitted when Ruth explained
that there was reason for Mr. Hicks wishing to
see him. &#8220;He told me he was mebbe going off for
a few days. &#8216;Then you send me a substitute, Jack
Crab,&#8217; I told him; but he only laughed and said
he wasn&#8217;t going to send a feller here to work into
his job. He <i>is</i> handy, I allow. But I&#8217;m too old
to be left all stark alone at this light. I&#8217;m going

to have another man when Jack&#8217;s month is out,
just as sure as eggs is eggs!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Hicks was just as polite to the old lady as
he had been to Miss Kate; and he quickly explained
his visit to the lighthouse, and showed
her the two letters that Crab had written.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, ain&#8217;t that the beatenest?&#8221; she cried.
&#8220;Jack Crab is just as mean as they make &#8217;em, I
always did allow. But this is the capsheaf of all
his didoes. And you say he run off with the little
girl the other night in Mr. Stone&#8217;s catboat? I
dunno where he could have taken her. And that
day he&#8217;d been traipsing off fishing with you folks
on the motor launch; hadn&#8217;t he? He&#8217;s been
leavin&#8217; me to do his work too much. This settles
it. Me and Jack Crab parts company at the
end of this month!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what is Mr. Hicks to do about his niece,
Mother Purling?&#8221; cried Ruth. &#8220;Will he pay
the five hundred dollars to you<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I just guess he won&#8217;t!&#8221; cried the old lady,
vigorously. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to be collector for
Crab in none of his risky dealin&#8217;s&#8211;no, ma&#8217;am!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he says he won&#8217;t give Nita up,&#8221; exclaimed
Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t help it. I&#8217;m a government employe.
I can&#8217;t afford to be mixed up in no such didoes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, I say, Missus!&#8221; exclaimed the cattleman,
&#8220;this is shore too bad! Ye might know
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>
somethin&#8217; about whar I kin find this yere reptile
by the name of Crab&#8211;though I reckon a crab is
a inseck, not a reptile,&#8221; and the ranchman grinned
ruefully.</p>

<p>The young folks could scarcely control their
laughter at this, and the idea that a crustacean
might be an insect was never forgotten by the
Cameron twins and Ruth Fielding.</p>

<p>&#8220;I dunno where he is,&#8221; said Mother Purling,
shortly. &#8220;I can&#8217;t keep track of the shiftless critter.
Ha&#8217;f the time when he oughter be here he&#8217;s
out fishing in the dory, yonder&#8211;or over to Thimble
Island.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which is Thimble Island?&#8221; asked Tom,
quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just yon,&#8221; said the lighthouse keeper, pointing
to a cone-shaped rock&#8211;perhaps an imaginative
person would call it thimble-shaped&#8211;lying
not far off shore. The lumber schooner had gone
on the reef not far from it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t no likelihood of his being over thar
now, Missus?&#8221; asked Mr. Hicks, quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;An&#8217; ye could purty nigh throw a stone to it!&#8221;
scoffed the old woman. &#8220;Not likely. B&#8217;sides, I
dunno as there&#8217;s a landin&#8217; on the island &#8217;ceptin&#8217; at
low tide. I reckon if he&#8217;s hidin&#8217;, Jack Crab is
farther away than the Thimble. But I don&#8217;t
know nothin&#8217; about him. And I can&#8217;t accept no
money for him&#8211;that&#8217;s all there is to that.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>And really, that did seem to be all there was to
it. Even such a go-ahead sort of a person as Mr.
Hicks seemed balked by the lighthouse keeper&#8217;s
attitude. There seemed nothing further to do
here.</p>

<p>Ruth was rather interested in what Mother
Purling had said about Thimble Island, and she
lingered to look at the conical rock, with the sea
foaming about it, when the others started down
the stairway. Tom came back for her.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you dreaming about, Ruthie?&#8221; he
demanded, nudging her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was wondering, Tommy,&#8221; she said, &#8220;just
why Jack Crab went so often to the Thimble, as
she says he does. I&#8217;d like to see that island
nearer to; wouldn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll borrow the catboat and sail out to it.
I can handle the <i>Jennie S.</i> I bet Helen would like
to go,&#8221; said Tom, at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t suppose that Crab man is there.
It&#8217;s just a barren rock,&#8221; said Ruth. &#8220;But I
<i>would</i> like to see the Thimble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you shall,&#8221; promised Tom.</p>

<p>But neither of them suspected to what strange
result that promise tended.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span><a id='link_23'></a>CHAPTER XXIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>MAROONED</span></h2>

<p><span class='sc'>It</span> was after luncheon before the three friends
got away from the Stone bungalow in the catboat.
Tom owned a catrigged boat himself on the Lumano
river, and Helen and Ruth, of course, were
not afraid to trust themselves to his management
of the <i>Jennie S.</i></p>

<p>The party was pretty well broken up that day,
anyway. Mercy and Miss Kate remained at
home and the others found amusement in different
directions. Nobody asked to go in the <i>Jennie S.</i>,
for which Ruth was rather glad.</p>

<p>Mr. Hicks had gone over to Sokennet with the
avowed intention of interviewing every soul in
the town for news of Jack Crab. Somebody,
surely, must know where the assistant lighthouse
keeper was, and the Westerner was not a man to
be put off by any ordinary evasion.</p>

<p>&#8220;My Jane Ann may be hiding over thar
amongst them fishermen,&#8221; he declared to Ruth before
he went away. &#8220;He couldn&#8217;t have sailed
far with her that night, if he was back in &#8217;twixt
two and three hours. No, sir-ree!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>And that was the thought in Ruth&#8217;s mind. Unless
Crab had sailed out and put Nita aboard a
New York, or Boston, bound steamer, it seemed
impossible that the girl could have gotten very
far from Lighthouse Point.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall we take one of the rowboats in tow,
Ruth?&#8221; queried Tom, before they left the Stone
dock.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; returned the girl of the Red Mill,
hastily. &#8220;We couldn&#8217;t land on that island, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only at low tide,&#8221; rejoined Tom. &#8220;But it
will be about low when we get outside the point.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t really suspect that Crab and Nita
are out there, Ruth?&#8221; whispered Helen, in her
chum&#8217;s ear.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a crazy idea; isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; laughed Ruth.
Yet she was serious again in a moment. &#8220;I
thought, when Mother Purling spoke of his going
there so much, that maybe he had a reason&#8211;a
particular reason.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Phineas told me that Jack Crab was the best
pilot on this coast,&#8221; remarked Tom. &#8220;He knows
every channel, and shoal, and reef from Westhampton
to Cape o&#8217; Winds. If there was a landing
at Thimble Island, and any secret place upon
it, Jack Crab would be likely to know of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you sail us around the Thimble?&#8221; asked
Ruth. &#8220;That&#8217;s all we want.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>&#8220;I asked Phin before we started. The sea is
clear for half a mile and more all around the
Thimble. We can circle it, all right, if the wind
holds this way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all I expect you to do, Tommy,&#8221; responded
Ruth, quickly.</p>

<p>But they all three eyed the conical-shaped rock
very sharply as the <i>Jennie S.</i> drew nearer. They
ran between the lighthouse and the Thimble. The
tide, in falling, left the green and slime-covered
ledges bare.</p>

<p>&#8220;A boat could get into bad quarters there, and
easily enough,&#8221; said Tom, as they ran past.</p>

<p>But when he tacked and the catboat swung her
head seaward, they began to observe the far side
of the Thimble. It was almost circular, and
probably all of a thousand yards in circumference.
The waves now ran up the exposed ledges, hissing
and gurgling among the cavities, and sometimes
throwing up spume-like geysers between the
boulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;A bad rock for any vessel to stub her toe
against trying to make Sokennet Harbor,&#8221; quoth
Tom Cameron. &#8220;They say that the wreckers
used to have a false beacon here in the old times.
They used to bring a sheep out here and tie a
lantern to its neck. Then, at low tide, they&#8217;d
drive the poor sheep over the rocks and the
bobbing up and down of the lantern would look
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>
like a riding light on some boat at anchor. Then
the lost vessel would dare run in for an anchorage,
too, and she&#8217;d be wrecked. Jack Crab&#8217;s
grandfather was hanged for it. So Phineas told
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How awful!&#8221; gasped Helen.</p>

<p>But Ruth suddenly seized her hand, exclaiming:
&#8220;See there! what is it fluttering on the rock?
Look, Tom!&#8221;</p>

<p>At the moment the boy could not do so, as
he had his hands full with the tiller and sheet,
and his eyes were engaged as well. When he
turned to look again at the Thimble, what had
startled Ruth had disappeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was something white fluttering against
the rock. It was down there, either below high-water
mark, or just above. I can&#8217;t imagine what
it was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A seabird, perhaps,&#8221; suggested Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then where did it go to so suddenly? I
did not see it fly away,&#8221; Ruth returned.</p>

<p>The catboat sailed slowly past the seaward
side of the Thimble. There were fifty places in
which a person might hide upon the rock&#8211;plenty
of broken boulders and cracks in the base of
the conical eminence that formed the peculiarly
shaped island.</p>

<p>The three watched the rugged shore very
sharply as the catboat beat up the wind&#8211;the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>
girls especially giving the Thimble their attention.
A hundred pair of eyes might have watched them
from the island, as far as they knew. But certainly
neither Ruth nor Helen saw anything to
feed their suspicion.</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall we do now?&#8221; demanded Tom.
&#8220;Where do you girls want to go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care,&#8221; Helen said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seen all you want to of that deserted island,
Ruthie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mind running back again, Tom?&#8221;
Ruth asked. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t any reason for asking
it&#8211;no good reason, I mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pshaw! if we waited for a reason for everything
we did, some things would never be done,&#8221;
returned Tom, philosophically.</p>

<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t a thing there,&#8221; declared Helen.
&#8220;But I don&#8217;t care in the least where you sail us,
Tom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only not to Davy Jones&#8217; Locker, Tommy,&#8221;
laughed Ruth.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll run out a way, and then come back with
the wind and cross in front of the island again,&#8221;
said Tom, and he performed this feat in a very
seamanlike manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;I declare! there&#8217;s a landing we didn&#8217;t see
sailing from the other direction,&#8221; cried Helen.
&#8220;See it&#8211;between those two ledges?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A regular dock; but you couldn&#8217;t land there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>
at high tide, or when there was any sea on,&#8221;
returned her brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the place!&#8221; exclaimed Ruth. &#8220;See
that white thing fluttering again? That&#8217;s no seagull.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ruth is right,&#8221; gasped Helen. &#8220;Oh, Tom!
There&#8217;s something fluttering there&#8211;a handkerchief,
is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sing out! as loud as ever you can!&#8221; commanded
the boy, eagerly. &#8220;Hail the rock.&#8221;</p>

<p>They all three raised their voices. There was
no answer. But Tom was pointing the boat&#8217;s
nose directly for the opening between the sharp
ledges.</p>

<p>&#8220;If there is nobody on the Thimble now, there
<i>has</i> been somebody there recently,&#8221; he declared.
&#8220;I&#8217;m going to drop the sail and run in there.
Stand by with the oars to fend off, girls. We
don&#8217;t want to scratch the catboat more than we
can help.&#8221;</p>

<p>His sister and Ruth sprang to obey him. Each
with an oar stood at either rail and the big
sail came down on the run. But the <i>Jennie S.</i>
had headway sufficient to bring her straight into
the opening between the ledges.</p>

<p>Tom ran forward, seized the rope in the bow,
and leaped ashore, carrying the coil of the painter
with him. Helen and Ruth succeeded in stopping
the boat&#8217;s headway with the oars, and the craft
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>
lay gently rocking in the natural dock, without
having scraped her paint an atom.</p>

<p>&#8220;A fine landing!&#8221; exclaimed Tom, taking a
turn or two with the rope about a knob of rock.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed,&#8221; returned Ruth. She gave a
look around. &#8220;My, what a lonely spot!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is lonely,&#8221; the youth answered. &#8220;Kind of
a Robinson Crusoe place,&#8221; and he gave a short
laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen!&#8221; cried Ruth, and held up her hand
as a warning.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you hear, Ruth?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought I heard somebody talking, or calling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You did?&#8221; Tom listened intently. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
hear anything.&#8221; He listened again. &#8220;Yes, I
do! Where did it come from?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it came from yonder,&#8221; and the girl
from the Red Mill pointed to a big, round rock
ahead of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe it did, Ruth. We&#8217;ll&#8211;yes, you are
right!&#8221; exclaimed the boy.</p>

<p>As he spoke there was a scraping sound ahead
of them and suddenly a tousled black head popped,
up over the top of the boulder from which fluttered
the bit of white linen that had first attracted
Ruth&#8217;s attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gracious goodness!&#8221; gasped Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Nita!&#8221; cried Ruth.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>&#8220;Oh, oh!&#8221; shrilled the lost girl, flying out of
concealment and meeting Ruth as she leaped
ashore. &#8220;Is it really you? Have you come for
me? I&#8211;I thought I&#8217;d have to stay here alone
forever. I&#8217;d given up all hope of any boat seeing
me, or my signal. I&#8211;I&#8217;m &#8217;most dead of fear,
Ruth Fielding! Do, do take me back to land
with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Western girl was clearly panic-stricken.
The boldness and independence she had formerly
exhibited were entirely gone. Being marooned
on this barren islet had pretty well sapped the
courage of Miss Jane Ann Hicks.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span><a id='link_24'></a>CHAPTER XXIV<br /><span class='h2fs'>PLUCKY MOTHER PURLING</span></h2>

<p><span class='sc'>Tom Cameron</span> audibly chuckled; but he made
believe to be busy with the painter of the catboat
and so did not look at the Western girl. The
harum-scarum, independent, &#8220;rough and ready&#8221;
runaway was actually on the verge of tears. But&#8211;really&#8211;it was
not surprising.</p>

<p>&#8220;How long have you been out here on this
rock?&#8221; demanded Helen, in horror.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ever since I left the bungalow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you wave your signal from the
top of the rock, so that it could be seen on the
point?&#8221; asked Ruth, wonderingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no way to get to the top of the
rock&#8211;or around to the other side of it, either,&#8221;
declared the runaway. &#8220;Look at these clothes!
They are nearly torn off. And see my hands!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you poor, poor thing!&#8221; exclaimed Helen,
seeing how the castaway&#8217;s hands were torn.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tried it. I&#8217;ve shouted myself hoarse. No
boat paid any attention to me. They were all
too far away, I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>&#8220;And did that awful man, Crab, bring you
here?&#8221; cried Ruth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. It was dark when he landed and
showed me this cave in the rock. There was
food and water. Why, I&#8217;ve got plenty to eat
and drink even now. But nobody has been
here<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t he come back?&#8221; queried Tom, at last
taking part in the conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;He rowed out here once. I told him I&#8217;d
sink his boat with a rock if he tried to land. I
was afraid of him,&#8221; declared the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;But why did you come here with him that
night?&#8221; demanded Ruth.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Cause I was foolish. I didn&#8217;t know he was
so bad then. I thought he&#8217;d really help me.
He told me Jennie&#8217;s aunt had written to my uncle<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Old Bill Hicks,&#8221; remarked Tom, chuckling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I&#8217;m Jane Hicks. I&#8217;m not Nita,&#8221; said
the girl, gulping down something like a sob.</p>

<p>&#8220;We read all about you in the paper,&#8221; said
Helen, soothingly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And your uncle&#8217;s come, and he&#8217;s just as anxious
to see you as he can be,&#8221; declared Ruth.</p>

<p>&#8220;So they <i>did</i> send for him?&#8221; cried Jane Ann.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Crab wrote a letter to Silver Ranch
himself. He got you out here so as to be sure
to collect five hundred dollars from your uncle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>
before he gave you up,&#8221; grunted Tom. &#8220;Nice
mess of things you made by running off from us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll go back with Uncle Bill&#8211;I will, indeed,&#8221;
said the girl. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been so lonely and
scared out here. Seems to me every time the tide
rose, I&#8217;d be drowned in that cave. The sea&#8217;s
horrid, I think! I never want to see it again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Tom observed, &#8220;I guess you won&#8217;t
have to worry about Crab any more. Get
aboard the catboat. We&#8217;ll slip ashore mighty
easy now, and let him whistle for you&#8211;or the
money. Mr. Hicks won&#8217;t have to pay for getting
you back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I expect he&#8217;s awful mad at me,&#8221; sighed Jane
Ann, <i>alias</i> Nita.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that he is awfully anxious to get you
back again, my dear,&#8221; said Ruth. &#8220;He is altogether
too good a man for you to run away
from.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you suppose I know that, Miss?&#8221;
snapped the girl from the ranch.</p>

<p>They embarked in the catboat and Tom showed
his seamanship to good advantage when he got
the <i>Jennie S.</i> out of that dock without rubbing
her paint. But the wind was very light and they
had to run down with it past the island and then
beat up between the Thimble and the lighthouse,
toward the entrance to Sokennet Harbor.</p>

<p>Indeed, the breeze fell so at times that the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>
catboat made no headway. In one of these calms
Helen sighted a rowboat some distance away,
but pulling toward them from among the little
chain of islands beyond the reef on which the
lumber schooner had been wrecked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a fisherman coming,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Do
you suppose he&#8217;d take us ashore in his boat, Tom?
We could walk home from the light. It&#8217;s growing
late and Miss Kate will be worried.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Sis, I can scull this old tub to the landing
below the lighthouse yonder. We don&#8217;t need
to borrow a boat. Then Phineas can come
around in the <i>Miraflame</i> to-morrow morning and
tow the catboat home.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Jane Ann had leaped up at once to eye
the coming rowboat&#8211;and not with favor.</p>

<p>&#8220;That looks like the boat that Crab came
out to the Thimble in,&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;Why!
it <i>is</i> him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jack Crab!&#8221; exclaimed Helen, in terror.
&#8220;He&#8217;s after you, then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well he won&#8217;t get her,&#8221; declared Tom,
boldly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What can we do against that man?&#8221; demanded
Ruth, anxiously. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid of him
myself. Let&#8217;s try to get ashore.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, before he catches us,&#8221; begged Helen.
&#8220;Do, Tom!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no hope of the wind helping them,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>
and the man in the rowboat was pulling strongly
for the becalmed <i>Jennie S.</i> Tom instantly
dropped her sail and seized one of the oars. He
could scull pretty well, and he forced the heavy
boat through the quiet sea directly for the lighthouse
landing.</p>

<p>The three girls were really much disturbed;
Crab pulled his lighter boat much faster than
Tom could drive the <i>Jennie S.</i> and it was a question
if he would not overtake her before she
reached the landing.</p>

<p>&#8220;He sees me,&#8221; said Jane Hicks, excitedly.
&#8220;He&#8217;ll get hold of me if he can. And maybe
he&#8217;ll hurt you folks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s got to catch us first,&#8221; grunted Tom,
straining at the oar.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to beat him, Tommy!&#8221; cried
Helen, encouragingly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t give up!&#8221;</p>

<p>Once Crab looked around and bawled some
threat to them over his shoulder. But they did
not reply. His voice inspired Tom with renewed
strength&#8211;or seemed to. The boy strained at
his single oar, and the <i>Jennie S.</i> moved landward
at a good, stiff pace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand ready with the painter, Ruth!&#8221; called
Tom, at last. &#8220;We must fasten the boat before
we run.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And where will we run to?&#8221; demanded
Helen.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>&#8220;To the light, of course,&#8221; returned her chum.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give <i>me</i> the hitch-rein!&#8221; cried Jane Ann
Hicks, snatching the coil of line from Ruth&#8217;s
hand, and the next moment she leaped from the
deck of the catboat to the wharf.</p>

<p>The distance was seven or eight feet, but she
cleared it and landed on the stringpiece. She
threw the line around one of the piles and made
a knot with a dexterity that would have surprised
her companions at another time.</p>

<p>But there was no opportunity then for Tom,
Helen and Ruth to stop to notice it. All three
got ashore the moment the catboat bumped, and
they left her where she was and followed the
flying Western girl up the wharf and over the
stretches of sand towards the lightkeeper&#8217;s cottage.</p>

<p>Before their feet were off the planks of the
wharf Jack Crab&#8217;s boat collided with the <i>Jennie
S.</i> and the man scrambled upon her deck, and
across it to the wharf. He left his own dory to
go ashore if it would, and set out to catch the
girl who&#8211;he considered&#8211;was worth five hundred
dollars to him.</p>

<p>But Jane Ann and her friends whisked into
the little white house at the foot of the light
shaft, and slammed the door before Crab reached
it.</p>

<p>&#8220;For the Land of Goshen!&#8221; cried the old
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>
lady, who was sitting knitting in her tiny sitting-room.
&#8220;What&#8217;s the meaning of this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Crab! It&#8217;s Jack Crab!&#8221; cried Helen,
almost in hysterics. &#8220;He&#8217;s after us!&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom had bolted the door. Now Crab thundered
upon it, with both feet and fists.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me in!&#8221; he roared from outside.
&#8220;Mother Purling! you let me git that gal!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What does this mean?&#8221; repeated the lighthouse
keeper, sternly. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t this the gal that
big man was after this morning?&#8221; she demanded,
pointing at Jane Ann.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Mrs. Purling&#8211;it is Jane Hicks. And
this dreadful Crab man has kept her out on the
Thimble all this time&#8211;alone!&#8221; cried Ruth.
&#8220;Think of it! Now he has chased us in
here<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll fix that Jack Crab,&#8221; declared the plucky
old woman, advancing toward the door. &#8220;Hi,
you, Jack! go away from there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You open this door, Mother Purling, if you
knows what&#8217;s best for you,&#8221; commanded the
sailor.</p>

<p>&#8220;You better git away from that door, if you
knows what&#8217;s best for <i>you</i>, Jack Crab!&#8221; retorted
the old woman. &#8220;I don&#8217;t fear ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see that man here this morning. Did he
leave aught for me?&#8221; cried Crab, after a moment.
&#8220;If he left the five hundred dollars he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>
promised to give for the gal, he can have her.
Give me the money, and I&#8217;ll go my ways.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t no go-between for a scoundrel such
as you, Jack Crab,&#8221; declared the lighthouse keeper.
&#8220;There&#8217;s no money here for ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll have the gal if I tear the lighthouse
down for it&#8211;stone by stone!&#8221; roared the fellow.</p>

<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s your kind that always blows before
they breeches,&#8221; declared Mother Purling, referring
to the habit of the whale, which spouts
before it upends and dives out of sight. &#8220;Go
away!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t go away!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, ye will, an&#8217; quick, too!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Old woman, ye don&#8217;t know me!&#8221; stormed
the unreasonable man. &#8220;I want that money, an&#8217;
I&#8217;m bound to have it&#8211;one way or th&#8217; other!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll get nuthin&#8217;, Jack Crab, but a broken
head if ye keep on in this fashion,&#8221; returned the
woman of the lighthouse, her honest wrath growing
greater every moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll see about that!&#8221; howled the man.
&#8220;Are ye goin&#8217; to let me in or not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I tell ye! Go away!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll bust my way in, see ef I don&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>

<p>At that the fellow threw himself against the
door, and the screws of one hinge began to tear
out of the woodwork. Mother Purling saw it,
and motioned the frightened girls and Tom toward
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>
the stairway which led to the gallery around
the lantern.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go up yon!&#8221; she commanded. &#8220;Shut and
lock that door on ye. He&#8217;ll not durst set foot on
government property, and that&#8217;s what the light is.
Go up.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shooed them all into the stairway and
slammed the door. There she stood with her
back against it, while, at the next blow, Jack
Crab forced the outer door of her cottage inward
and fell sprawling across its wreck into the room.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span><a id='link_25'></a>CHAPTER XXV<br /><span class='h2fs'>WHAT JANE ANN WANTED</span></h2>

<p><span class='sc'>Ruth</span> and her companions could not see what
went on in the cottage; but they did not mount the
stairs. They could not leave the old woman&#8211;plucky
as she was&#8211;to fight Jack Crab alone.</p>

<p>But they need not have been so fearful for
Mother Purling&#8217;s safety. The instant the man
fell into the main room of the cottage, Mother
Purling darted to the stove, seized the heavy
poker which lay upon the hearth, and sprang for
the rascal.</p>

<p>Jack Crab had got upon his knees, threatening
her with dire vengeance. The old lighthouse
keeper never said a word in reply, but brought
the heavy poker down upon his head and shoulders
with right good will, and Jack Crab&#8217;s tune
changed on the instant.</p>

<p>Again and again Mother Purling struck him.
He rolled upon the floor, trying to extricate himself
from the wreck of her door, and so escape.</p>

<p>But before he could do this, and before the
old woman had ceased her attack, there was a
shout outside, a horse was brought to an abrupt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>
halt at the gate, and a huge figure in black flung
itself from the saddle, and came running through
the gate and up to the cottage.</p>

<p>&#8220;What you got there, Missus?&#8221; roared the
deep voice of Bill Hicks, of Bullhide, and at the
sound of his voice Jane Ann burst open the door
at the foot of the stairs and ran out to meet
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;This here&#8217;s the man you want to meet, I
guess,&#8221; panted the old woman, desisting at length
in her use of the poker. &#8220;Do ye want him now,
Mister?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Uncle Bill!&#8221; shrieked Jane Ann.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great cats!&#8221; cried the cattleman. &#8220;Is it
Jane Ann herself? Is she alive?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl flung herself into the big man&#8217;s arms.
&#8220;I&#8217;m all right, Uncle!&#8221; she cried, laughing and
crying together. &#8220;And that man yonder didn&#8217;t
hurt me&#8211;only kep&#8217; me on a desert island till
Ruth and Tom and Helen found me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he kin go!&#8221; declared Bill Hicks, turning
suddenly as Crab started through the door.
&#8220;And here&#8217;s what will help him!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Westerner swung his heavy boot with the
best intention in the world and caught Jack Crab
just as he was going down the step. With a yell
of pain the fellow sailed through the air, landing
at least ten feet from the doorway. But he
was up from his hands and knees and running
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>
hard in an instant, and he ran so hard, and to
such good purpose, that he ran right out of this
story then and there. Ruth Fielding and her
friends never saw the treacherous fellow again.</p>

<p>&#8220;But if he&#8217;d acted like he oughter,&#8221; said Mr.
Hicks, &#8220;and hadn&#8217;t put my Jane Ann out on that
thar lonesome rock, and treated her the way he
done, I should have considered myself in his debt.
I&#8217;d have paid him the five hundred dollars, sure
enough. I&#8217;d have paid it over willingly if he&#8217;d
left my gal with these nice people and only told
me whar she was. But I wouldn&#8217;t give him a cent
now&#8211;not even if he was starvin&#8217;. For if I found
him in that condition I&#8217;d see he got food and not
money,&#8221; and the big man chuckled.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you haven&#8217;t got to pay five hundred dollars
for me, then, Uncle Bill?&#8221; said his niece, as
they sat on the porch of the Stones&#8217; bungalow,
talking things over.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I haven&#8217;t. No fault of yours, though,
you little rascal. I dunno but I ought to divide
it &#8217;twixt them three friends of yourn that found
ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not for us!&#8221; cried Tom and Helen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor for me,&#8221; said Ruth, earnestly. &#8220;It
would not be right. I never should respect myself
again if I thought I had tried to find Nita
for money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if it hadn&#8217;t been for Ruth we&#8217;d never
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>
have sailed over there to the Thimble,&#8221; declared
Tom.</p>

<p>The Western girl had been thinking seriously;
now she seized her uncle by the arm. &#8220;I tell
you what I want, Uncle Bill!&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something beside the pianner and the shift-on
hat?&#8221; he grumbled, but his blue eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those things don&#8217;t count,&#8221; she declared
earnestly. &#8220;But this five hundred dollars, Uncle
Bill, you haven&#8217;t got to pay that Crab man. So
you just spend it by taking all these girls and boys
that have been so nice to me out to Silver Ranch.
They think it must be the finest place that ever
happened&#8211;and I don&#8217;t know but &#8217;tis, Uncle, if
you don&#8217;t have too much of it,&#8221; she added.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great cats! that would shore be some doin&#8217;s;
wouldn&#8217;t it?&#8221; exclaimed the cattleman, grinning
broadly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet it would! We&#8217;ll take Ruth and
Helen and Tom and Heavy an&#8211;why, every
last one of &#8217;em that&#8217;ll go. We&#8217;ll show &#8217;em a right
good time; is it a go, Uncle Bill?&#8221;</p>

<p>And it certainly was &#8220;a go,&#8221; for we shall meet
Ruth and her friends next in a volume entitled,
&#8220;Ruth Fielding at Silver Ranch; Or, Schoolgirls
Among the Cowboys.&#8221;</p>

<p>Old Bill Hicks&#8217; hearty invitation could not be
accepted, however, until the various young folks
had written home to their parents and guardians
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>
about it. And the expectation of what fun they
could have on Silver Ranch did not spoil the
fun to be found closer at hand, at Lighthouse
Point.</p>

<p>The remainder of that fortnight at the bungalow
would long be remembered by Ruth and her
girl friends, especially. Mr. Hicks got board at
Sokennet; but Jane Ann (although they all called
her &#8220;Nita&#8221; save The Fox, who took some delight
in teasing her about her ugly name) remained
at the bungalow. The cattleman could
not do too much for anybody who had been kind
to his niece, and had the life saving men not refused
absolutely to accept anything from him,
he would have made them all a present because
they had rescued Jane Ann from the wreck of the
<i>Whipstitch</i>.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Mr. Hicks found out something
that he <i>could</i> do for the life-savers, and he presented
the station with a fine library&#8211;something
which all the surfmen, and Cap&#8217;n Abinadab as well,
could enjoy during the long winter days and evenings.
Nor did the ranchman forget Mother Purling
at the lighthouse. Up from New York came
the finest black silk dress and bonnet that the
big man could buy for money in any shop, and no
present could have so delighted the plucky old
lighthouse keeper. She had longed, she said, for
a black silk dress all her life.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>Before the young folks departed from Lighthouse
Point, too, Miss Kate invited the life-savers,
and Mother Purling, and Phineas and
some of the other longshoremen and their wives
to a &#8220;party&#8221; at the bungalow. And there were
good things to eat (Heavy saw to <i>that</i>, of course)
and a moving-picture entertainment brought down
from the city for that evening, and a big display
of fireworks afterward on the shore.</p>

<p>This wound up Ruth Fielding&#8217;s visit to Lighthouse
Point. The fortnight of fun was ended
all too soon. She and Helen and Tom, and the
rest of the visitors, started for home, all promising,
if their parents and guardians agreed, to
meet Jane Ann Hicks and her uncle a week later,
in Syracuse, ready for the long and delightful
journey across the continent to Bullhide, Montana.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we certainly did have some great
times,&#8221; was Tom&#8217;s comment, after the last goodbyes
had been spoken and the young folks were
homeward bound.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it was lovely,&#8221; answered his twin sister.
&#8220;And think of how we helped Nita&#8211;I mean
Jane Ann.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Most of the credit for that goes to Ruth,&#8221;
said Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; cried the girl from the Red Mill.
&#8220;Yes, we certainly had a grand time,&#8221; she added.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>
&#8220;I love the bounding sea, and the shifting sands,
and the lighthouse, and all!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I do hope we can go out to that ranch!&#8221;
sighed Helen. &#8220;I have always wanted to visit
such a place, to see the cattle and the cowboys,
and the boundless prairies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I want to ride a broncho,&#8221; put in her
brother. &#8220;They say some of &#8217;em can go like
the wind. Ruth, you&#8217;ll have to ride, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take your last look at the sea!&#8221; came from
Heavy. &#8220;Maybe we won&#8217;t get another look at
it for a long time.&#8221;</p>

<p>All turned to look at the rolling waves, glistening
brightly in the Summer sun.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it lovely!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye, Old Ocean, good-bye!&#8221; sang out
Helen.</p>

<p>Ruth threw a kiss to the waves.</p>

<p>Then the ocean faded from their sight. And
here we will leave Ruth Fielding and say good-bye.</p>

<p>May Hollis Barton is a new writer for girls who is bound to win instant

<p>When the three chums arrived at the boarding school they found
the other students in the grip of a most perplexing mystery. How
this mystery was solved, and what good times the girls had, both in
school and on the lake, go to make a story no girl would care to miss.</p>

<p>Showing how Nell, when she had a ranch girl visit her in Boston,

town and then a city.</p>

<span class='fs14'>THE LINGER-NOT SERIES</span><br />
<span class='fs12'>By AGNES MILLER</span><br />
<i>12mo. Cloth. Illustrated. Jacket in full colors</i><br />
<i>Price per volume, 65 cents, postpaid</i>
</p>

<p>This new series of girls&#8217; books is in a new
style of story writing. The interest is in knowing
the girls and seeing them solve the problems
that develop their character. Incidentally, a
great deal of historical information is imparted.</p>

<p>1. THE LINGER-NOTS AND THE MYSTERY HOUSE<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;or The Story of Nine Adventurous Girls</p>

<p>How the Linger-Not girls met and formed their club seems commonplace,
but this writer makes it fascinating, and how they made their club
serve a great purpose continues the interest to the end, and introduces
a new type of girlhood.</p>

<p>2. THE LINGER-NOTS AND THE VALLEY FEUD<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;or The Great West Point Chain</p>

<p>The Linger-Not girls had no thought of becoming mixed up with
feuds or mysteries, but their habit of being useful soon entangled
them in some surprising adventures that turned out happily for all,
and made the valley better because of their visit.</p>

<p>3. THE LINGER-NOTS AND THEIR GOLDEN QUEST<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;or The Log of the Ocean Monarch</p>

<p>For a club of girls to become involved in a mystery leading back
into the times of the California gold-rush, seems unnatural until the
reader sees how it happened, and how the girls helped one of their
friends to come into her rightful name and inheritance, forms a fine
story.</p>

<p>4. THE LINGER-NOTS AND THE WHISPERING CHARMS<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;or The Secret from Old Alaska</p>

<p>Whether engrossed in thrilling adventures in the Far North or
occupied with quiet home duties, the Linger-Not girls could work
unitedly to solve a colorful mystery in a way that interpreted
American freedom to a sad young stranger, and brought happiness
to her and to themselves.</p>
